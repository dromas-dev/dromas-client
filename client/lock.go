// The mailbox's lock is its state file, the bbolt database "state", held open by
// a command from its start to its end ([Mailbox.hold]). bbolt takes an exclusive
// flock on it, so one command of a mailbox runs at a time and none reads what
// another is half way through writing, and the kernel lets go of it however
// the process that held it ended (#235). signal-cli does the same with one
// lock on an account's file, held for a whole command and waited for by the
// next. A lock-free layout, Maildir's name per message renamed into place,
// fits a file written once, and not what a mailbox reads, compares and writes
// again, such as its revocations and a peer's serials (decided on #62, #83 and
// #96). A base directory on NFS, where a flock is not one to rely on, is refused
// where the system can tell ([CheckLayout], #188).
//
// In one process, goroutines that share a Mailbox take turns in its slot first
// (claim), at each exported entry that reads or writes the state file, so a
// command of one waits for another's as a command of another process does
// (#329).
