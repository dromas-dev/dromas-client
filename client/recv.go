//
//  1. Decryption with every retained prekey, of a file with exactly one
//     native recipient stanza, counted before anything is decrypted
//     (decrypt, oneNative).
//  2. What came out is an envelope line and then a signature block.
//  3. The envelope is one JSON object, as protocol.Unmarshal reads one.
//  4. The line carries the sender's identity document, and its from is that
//     document's hash.
//  5. The signature over the line as decrypted, in this mailbox's message
//     namespace, by that identity or a working key it certified.
//  6. The rest of the envelope: version 1, to is this mailbox, msg_id in its
//     form, and sent_at no older than protocol.TTL, not before the
//     floor the seen-set was pruned at (seenFloor), and at most
//     protocol.MaxSkew ahead.
//  7. Revocation: this mailbox holds no revocation of the sender. The server is
//     asked for one, once for each sender in a drain. A revocation that
//     verifies refuses the message and every later one, whenever they were
//     signed. A server that says it holds none has answered. No answer is an
//     error: the message stays on the server for the next drain. The same
//     answer carries the sender's revocation of its certificates, if it has
//     one: a message signed under a revoked certificate is refused the same
//     way, and the address goes on. The identity's own signature is never
//     covered by it (protocol.Admits).
//  8. Replay: the locally computed ciphertext hash is not in the seen-set.
//  9. Retry: (from, msg_id) is not in the seen-set. A match is a duplicate.
//
// The numbers are PROTOCOL.md §12.3's. protocol.Examine makes checks 2 to 6,
// all but the floor, which is this mailbox's own and judge's. Who the sender is,
// is never asked of the server, nor read from its list: the message carries
// what proves it. The one thing asked is whether a revocation of that sender
// exists, and the answer proves itself. The sender's identity is pinned only
// once all of that has passed.
