// The mailbox's format is one number for how its files are laid out and what
// each holds, the state file's records among them: client/doc.go lists each
// format and what it changed. The state file keeps it in its meta bucket
// under "format", a decimal integer, as etcd keeps its storage version and git
// its repository format version. A state file that records none, and a
// mailbox with no state file at all (one restored from its identity alone, or
// from a backup without it, or whose state file was deleted), are format 1:
// the oldest, so that bringing it forward reads every older layout right. So
// each step that changes the layout recognises the old form from the files
// themselves, and does nothing where it finds none. The identity, the address
// and the identity document Open derives from it are outside every format: Open
// reads and writes them before the format is read, so no format moves them.
// Where a part of the mailbox is, is its Layout's and no format's.
