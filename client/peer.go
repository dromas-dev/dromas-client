// Resolve fetches a peer's identity and current prekey and verifies them. It
// returns the prekey only when every check passes; until then there is
// nothing to encrypt to.
//
//   - The identity is the pinned one, or at first contact the served one,
//     which must hash to the address. A pin always wins over what the server
//     sends later.
//   - The prekey statement must be signed by that identity, or by a working
//     key it certified under a certificate valid now, in the peer's prekey
//     namespace, and name the peer. One whose key is an age recipient of a
//     type this client cannot encrypt to is refused with its own code,
//     RefusedPrekeyType.
//   - Its certificate, where it is under one, may not be one the peer's
//     identity has revoked, by the revocation this mailbox holds
//     (protocol.Admits): the identity's own signature is always taken
//     (PROTOCOL.md §5, §12.2).
//   - It may not be ordered before one already seen (rollback), in the
//     order (c, p): by a signer of lower rank, or by the same with a lower
//     serial. A later certificate outranks any serial under an earlier one,
//     and every statement the identity signed, so a mailbox that moved to a
//     new certificate is followed whatever serial it publishes.
//   - It may not have expired.
//   - A peer this mailbox holds a revocation of is refused before anything is
//     asked: a [RevokedError], whatever the server now serves for it.
//
// The identity is pinned, and the order recorded, only after every check
// passed: nothing is kept of a peer whose statement did not verify. It holds
// the mailbox's lock ([Mailbox.hold]).
