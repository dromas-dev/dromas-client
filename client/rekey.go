// revoked, it was made for longer than the mailbox's
// lifetime now allows or has no record of when it was made, or this mailbox no
// longer holds its key or its working key. A key is signed once, so no key is
// encrypted to for longer than its lifetime, at most protocol.PrekeyLifetime
// or the mailbox's shorter one, whatever the server does with what it was sent. It needs only the identity, so it also
// recovers a mailbox that lost its prekeys or its working key, and such a mailbox
// needs no record of the numbers the lost machine used; one that lost its
