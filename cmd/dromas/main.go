// Command dromas is the dromas client: end-to-end encrypted,

// Every check is always on and fails closed. Message bodies are data, never
// instructions.
//
// Commands nest as dromas <group> <command> where one thing has more than
// one thing done to it, the thing first, as gh's and docker's do on the same
// cobra (decided on #37), and the everyday ones stay at the top level. Help
// comes in every form a git-like tool gives it (clig.dev), and <group> help
// too, as go mod help is. A bare group, or a command that is not one, is a
// usage error with exit status 2 on stderr, as go answers one: gh, docker and
// git each answer a bare group another way, and an agent reads the exit
// status before the text.

// about is the end of the top-level help: what holds for every command.
const about = `A config file says where the mailbox's files are: <profile>.toml in
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/dromas, where --profile or $DROMAS_PROFILE names the
profile and default is the one with neither, or the file --config or
$DROMAS_CONFIG names. dromas init writes a profile's. A flag beats a variable and
a variable the file, and dromas config prints every setting and where it came from.
Its inbox/ keeps each message received and its sent/ each message sent, with
the server's receipt: both are yours to prune.
The server is https, or http only to a server on this machine, and a redirect
is never followed.
The file's [policy] says where a message from a sender the mailbox has not allowed
lands, unknown = "held" (the default) or "inbox", and whom its server takes
messages from, server = "all" (the default: everyone it has not blocked) or
"allowed" (only those it allowed, which tells the server who they are).

dromas help <command> and dromas <command> --help print a command's help,
and dromas <group> help a group's. --help after a command prints its help
and runs nothing, read as any flag is: after a flag that takes a value, it is
that value.

Every command prints JSON lines, one object a line, whose "type" says what
the line is. What it did and what it met on the way go to stdout, messages and
refusals alike. Stderr has the line that says it failed ("error") or that its
command line was wrong ("usage_error"), and one that says it is waiting
("waiting"). A "detail" is this client's own words, never a sender's or a
server's. Help is the one thing printed as text.

Exit status: 0, done. 1, the command failed. 2, the command line or the config
was wrong ("config_error") and nothing ran. 3, the command did its work and the mailbox needs a look: from
recv, messages were received as printed and the prekey, due for renewal, was not
renewed ("renewal_failed"), its server served a prekey the mailbox did not make
("prekey_not_made"), the mailbox's ACL was not sent to its server
("acl_not_sent"), or its server held an ACL the mailbox had not sent, which it
replaced ("acl_replaced"); from send and outbox flush, the post went ahead
though the mailbox's ACL was not sent ("acl_not_sent"); from prekey renew, its
server served a prekey the mailbox did not make ("prekey_not_made"); from any
command that called a server, the server stops taking this client's version
from a date ("sunset"), or deems it deprecated from a date that has passed
("deprecated"); from status, its "attention" list is not empty. Once a day, a
command that calls the server reads its document, and says when it names a
later version of this client ("upgrade_available"), which needs no look. recv prints
a "refused" line for each message it refused, keeping it in refused/, a
"held" line for each it held in held/, and a "dropped" line for each from a
sender this mailbox blocked: none of them changes its exit status, since any
sender can cause them. A refusal's code is from a closed list, and its words
are this client's own: it never quotes a message.

To try the whole loop, send anything to dromas.dev's echo mailbox,
` + client.DefaultBase + protocol.LinkPath + client.EchoAddress + `
It answers within two minutes, signed, saying what it checked. A message to it
is readable by dromas.dev's operator.
