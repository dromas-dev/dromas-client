# The Dromas Protocol, version 1

**Status: draft.** Nothing here is final until version 1 is declared stable. What must be settled first is the open issues of this repository and of dromas-server.

## 1. Introduction

Dromas carries end-to-end encrypted, sender-authenticated messages between programs, through a store-and-forward server. A *mailbox* is named by its *address*, the hash of its identity key's public document, so an address authenticates the key it names and needs no directory. A sender encrypts to the recipient's *prekey*, which the recipient's identity signed, and signs the message inside the encryption. The identity signs what its mailbox signs, or a *working key* the identity certified signs in its place, so the identity can be kept away from daily work (Section 5). The server stores ciphertext. It holds no private key, no plaintext and no signature over any message.

The server is not trusted for confidentiality or for authenticity: every check that protects a message is a client's. Section 15 states what a hostile server can and cannot do.

This document specifies the formats, the meaning of each HTTP operation, and what a client and a server check. Alongside it:

- **`api/openapi.yaml` is normative for the HTTP shapes:** routes, methods, request and answer members with their types, status codes, error codes and headers. This document says what each operation means, who may call it, what is checked and what each refusal means.
Where the two disagree, `api/openapi.yaml` is right about a shape and this document about a meaning.
- **`testdata/vectors/` holds the conformance vectors** (Section 16).
- **`PRECEDENTS.md`** sets each design decision beside the published standards and deployed systems that make the same one.

## 2. Conventions

### 2.1. Requirements language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 2.2. Notation

- A *line* ends in LF (0x0A). A text "of N lines" is exactly N lines: no CR, and nothing after the last LF.
- `‖` is concatenation. `str(x)` is a uint32 big-endian length followed by the bytes of `x` (RFC 4251 §5).
- An **address** is written as 77 characters of lowercase base32 (RFC 4648 §6) without padding, wherever it appears: a path, a statement, an envelope, a namespace.
- A **time** is RFC 3339 in UTC to the second, exactly `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. What ends at a time has ended at that second: it is valid while a clock reads before it.
- A **serial** is a decimal integer from 1 to 2^53 − 1 with no leading zero. 2^53 − 1 is the largest integer every JSON reader holds exactly (Section 3.3).
- **base64** is standard base64 (RFC 4648 §4) in its one encoding: padded, with no character outside the alphabet (a line break included), and the unused bits of its last character zero, so that encoding the bytes again gives the same text. Two places differ, and say so: the armour of a signature (Section 3.2) and an adopt key (Section 11.16).
- In a namespace or a statement, `<A>` is the address of the mailbox that signs it.

### 2.3. Terms

- **Mailbox:** an address, its keys and its messages.
- **Identity key:** a mailbox's long-term signing key, of a key type Section 4 defines. It signs certificates (Section 5.2) and revocations (Section 10), and may sign everything else a mailbox signs (Section 5).
- **Identity document `D`:** the two-line text that carries the identity's public key (Section 4.1). **Address `H`:** the SHA-384 of `D` (Section 4.2). One identity key has exactly one address.
- **Working key:** an Ed25519 key that the identity certifies (Section 5.2). It signs prekey statements, messages and passes in the identity's place.
- **Certificate:** the OpenSSH user certificate by which the identity certifies a working key (Section 5.2).
- **Signer:** the signing key a prekey statement, a pass or a message carries: the identity key or a certificate. Its **rank** is 0 for the identity and its serial for a certificate (Section 5).
- **Statement:** a fixed-form text of lines, each ended by LF, that a key signs with SSHSIG (Section 3.2): a prekey statement (Section 6), a pass (Section 8), a revocation (Section 10).
- **Prekey:** a mailbox's current age encryption key. **Prekey statement:** its publication, signed by the mailbox's signer (Section 6). A prekey is **retired** once the server takes a later statement.
- **Renewal:** the publication of a new prekey statement (Section 11.9).
- **Pass:** a statement a mailbox signs to prove itself to its server on a call (Section 8).
- **Envelope:** the signed JSON line that carries a message's metadata and body (Section 9.1).
- **Server:** the mailbox server a mailbox is registered at and calls: the whole system its operator runs to answer at the server's name, whatever terminates TLS for it included (Section 15.8). A mailbox's **own server** is the one it registered at.
- **TTL:** 33 days: the longest a server keeps a message (Section 13) and a reader takes it as fresh (Section 12.3, check 6).
- **Active, revoked, unknown:** the states of a mailbox at a server (Section 11.6).
- **Served:** as a server answers it when a mailbox is read (Section 11.8): the server's word until a client has verified it.
- **Pinned:** a peer's identity that a client keeps once something it signed has verified, and uses over the served one ever after (Section 12.2).
- **No answer:** what a client takes a call to have had when it failed, or when its answer breaks the form this document gives it (Sections 3.3, 11.1, 11.2, 12.3): it says nothing about what was asked.
- **Drain:** a client's pass over its mailbox: every page of its list, each message fetched, judged and acked (Section 12.3).
- **Native stanza:** an age recipient stanza of a type a prekey has, `mlkem768x25519` (Section 9.4).
- **Floor:** the cutoff a mailbox's replay set has been pruned to (Section 12.3, check 8).

## 3. Primitives

### 3.1. Algorithms

| Name | Role | Specification |
|---|---|---|
| age v1 | encryption to a prekey: `mlkem768x25519`, the hybrid ML-KEM-768 + X25519 recipient | C2SP age |
| Ed25519 | the identity key of type `ssh-ed25519`; the working key of an identity of either type of Section 4.1 | RFC 8032 |
| ECDSA P-256 | the identity key of the optional type `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` | FIPS 186-5, RFC 5656 |
| SSHSIG | every signature: the signer's signature over SHA-512 of the message, in a namespace | OpenSSH `PROTOCOL.sshsig` |
| SSH public key text | `<key type> <base64 of the wire key>` | RFC 4253 §6.6, RFC 8709, RFC 5656 |
| OpenSSH certificate | the certificate of a working key | draft-ietf-sshm-cert |
| SHA-384 | the address | FIPS 180-4 |
| SHA-256 | a message's id | FIPS 180-4 |
| UUID | an envelope's `msg_id` | RFC 9562 |

A keyed hash in this protocol is HMAC or HKDF, inside age. Plain SHA-384 and SHA-256 are applied only to public inputs: the identity document and the ciphertext.

### 3.2. Signatures

Every signature is an SSHSIG (`PROTOCOL.sshsig`) in one form, the bytes `ssh-keygen -Y sign` writes. The signing key signs

    "SSHSIG" ‖ str(namespace) ‖ str("") ‖ str("sha512") ‖ str(SHA-512(message))

and the signature is the blob

    "SSHSIG" ‖ u32(1) ‖ str(signing key) ‖ str(namespace) ‖ str("") ‖ str("sha512") ‖ str(signature)

armoured: the line `-----BEGIN SSH SIGNATURE-----`, the blob's base64 (Section 2.2) in lines of 70 characters, the last of 1 to 70, then the line `-----END SSH SIGNATURE-----`, each line ended by LF, with nothing before the first or after the last.

- **The signing key** is the signer (Section 5), in SSH wire form: for what the identity signs, the bare identity key, the bytes of the identity document's line 2; for what a working key signs, the certificate.
- **The signature** is of the signing key's type, a certificate's being its certified key's: for `ssh-ed25519`, `str("ssh-ed25519") ‖ str(R ‖ S)`, 64 bytes (RFC 8709 §6); for `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `str("ecdsa-sha2-nistp256") ‖ str(mpint(r) ‖ mpint(s))` (RFC 5656 §3.1.2), each mpint as RFC 4251 §5 defines it, with no leading zero byte but the one a set high bit needs.
- **One form.** A verifier MUST parse the armour and the blob, write the signature again in this form from what it parsed, and refuse the signature, before it verifies it, where the two differ by any byte. So a verifier refuses every other way of writing one: another line end or line length, whitespace in the base64, a byte before the BEGIN line or after the last LF, a version other than 1, a hash other than `sha512`, a reserved field that is not empty, a NUL in a string, an integer with a leading zero byte it does not need.
- **ECDSA's two values of s.** Where (r, s) is a P-256 signature, so is (r, n − s), n the group's order (FIPS 186-5): each is a signature in the one form, a verifier MUST take both, and neither is required of a signer. Anyone who has seen one can write the other (Sections 5.2, 8). An Ed25519 signature has no second.
- **A bound on size, per identity key type:** the longest signature in the one form that a mailbox of that type signs, with its identity or with a working key under a certificate as `ssh-keygen -s` writes one (Section 5.2): a nonce of 32 bytes, no extension and an empty reserved field. The one form fixes every other byte of a signature but its namespace's and, for ECDSA, how many bytes r and s take. For `ssh-ed25519` the bound is exact, 878 bytes: a prekey statement or a pass under a certificate. For `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` it is 975, the same with the identity's r and s on the certificate each in 33 bytes, the most the one form gives them. Everything a mailbox signs is held to its identity's bound; in a message, the block from its BEGIN line through the LF after its END line (Section 9.2). Every verifier, a server included, MUST refuse a longer signature before verifying it, and one longer than the largest bound of any key type before reading it. A key type added later states its own bound and leaves the others unchanged.
- **An Ed25519 signature's S is below the group order L** (RFC 8032 §5.1.7), in an SSHSIG and on a certificate.
- **The Ed25519 equation** is RFC 8032 §5.1.7's without the cofactor, `[S]B = R + [k]A'`, compared as encodings: a neutral R is taken, and R with a point of small order added is refused.

### 3.3. JSON

Every JSON text the protocol carries is read by these rules, by a server and by a client: a request body, an answer, an envelope (Section 9.1) with the body in it, a revocation record (Section 10.3), and what a client keeps of one. A text that breaks one is refused whole: a request with `400 bad_request` (`bad_encoding` for a byte member), an answer as no answer, an envelope as `bad_envelope`.

- **I-JSON** (RFC 7493): UTF-8; no member named twice in any object, after its escapes are read; no surrogate and no Unicode noncharacter in a name or a string, written or escaped.
- **One object,** and nothing after it but whitespace (space, tab, LF, CR). No byte-order mark.
- **Names match exactly,** case and all.
- **Numbers** are in JSON's grammar (RFC 8259 §6), and none is of greater magnitude than a binary64 holds. A nonzero number too small for binary64 is taken.
- **Depth:** at most 32, objects and arrays counted together, the outermost as one.
- **Types.** A member the protocol defines is of its type, and null is the same as the member left out, except the envelope's `body` (Section 9.1). An integer member is written in digits alone, from 0 to 2^53 − 1: `1.0` and `1e0` are not integers.
- **Bytes.** A byte member is base64 (Section 2.2).
- **Unknown members.** A server MUST refuse a member it does not know in what it is sent. Every other reader MUST ignore one: a client in an answer, a mailbox in an envelope. The rules above hold in it.

### 3.4. Clocks

Every check of a time is exact at the clock of whoever makes the check, with no allowance. Whoever makes a time-limited object leaves an hour of room for clocks that differ, in the way each object's section states: a certificate's start at a verifier (Section 5.2), a prekey statement's ceiling at a server (Section 6), a pass's lifetime (Section 8), a reader's limit on `sent_at` (Section 12.3, check 6), a renewal's timing (Section 12.4), and the server's keep of messages (Section 13).

## 4. Identity and address

### 4.1. The identity document

The identity document `D` is two lines of ASCII: the tag, then one SSH public key as `<key type> <base64 of the wire key>`, with no comment:

```
dromas-v1
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI<43 characters>
```

The key MUST be of a type this section defines, in its one encoding, and MUST pass that type's key checks. Its one encoding is the wire key as OpenSSH writes it back once read: the key, parsed as the type line 2 names and written again, gives the same bytes. So one key has one document, and one address.

| Key type | Document | What fixes its one encoding | Key checks | Working key |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ssh-ed25519` | 91 bytes | the key's length, 32 (RFC 8709 §4) | a canonical point, not of small order | `ssh-ed25519` |
| `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` | 171 bytes | the curve's name, `nistp256`, and an uncompressed point | the point on the curve, not the point at infinity, each coordinate below the field's size | `ssh-ed25519` |

- **Every client MUST verify `ssh-ed25519`,** and a client MUST NOT make an identity of any other type unless its owner asks for one. Every other type is OPTIONAL: a client verifies it or not, and a server registers it or not (Section 11.7). A mailbox of an optional type can be written to, and heard from, only by mailboxes whose clients verify that type (Section 7).
- **The working key column** is the type of every working key an identity of that type certifies (Section 5). A type defined later states its own, as it states its own signature bound (Section 3.2).
- **The form is the same for every key type, defined here or not:** the tag line; a key type's name (RFC 4251 §6: printable ASCII with no comma, at most 64 characters); one space; the base64 of an SSH wire key that begins with that same name; LF. A reader MUST refuse a well-formed document of a type it does not verify as `unsupported_key_type`, never as malformed: a document that breaks the form, or does not hash to its address, is evidence of tampering, and one of a type the reader lacks is not.

### 4.2. The address

The address is the SHA-384 of `D`, its 48 bytes in base32 (RFC 4648 §6) without padding and in lowercase, as Tor writes an onion address: 77 characters of `a`–`z` and `2`–`7`, `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary < identity.doc | base32 | tr -d '=' | tr A-Z a-z`. 384 bits leave the last character one unused bit, which is zero, so each address has one text form.

- **SHA-384 is NIST's category 4 for collisions** (SHA-256 is category 2), and the address is the one part of a mailbox that never changes: whatever else is renewed, a second preimage of it names the mailbox for good.
- **It has one case and never begins with `-`:** no two addresses differ only in case, so a file named by one is that address's alone on any file system, and a command line never reads one as an option.

- It commits to the identity alone, so renewing or changing the type of the prekey never changes it.
- It has no checksum: a mistyped address names no mailbox.
- Line 1 of `D` is the protocol's version. Another deployment of this protocol uses its own tag, and so its own address space.
- A client MUST write `from` (Section 9.1) in lowercase: a reader compares it with the verified signer as an exact string.

### 4.3. The link

An address is shared as the link `https://<server>/to/<address>`.

- A server MUST serve a page there for exactly 77 characters of lowercase base32, and `404` for any other path. The page is fixed text, the address and the server's own link to it, and never text a mailbox supplied, sent with `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`. A query on the link is ignored.
- A client given a link MUST take the address from its path, MUST NOT fetch the page, and MUST refuse a link to any server but its own.

## 5. Signers

Every prekey statement, pass and message a mailbox signs carries an SSHSIG (Section 3.2) whose signing key is its **signer**, of one of two forms:

| Signer | Rank |
|---|---|
| The identity key, the key of the identity document's line 2, byte for byte | 0 |
| A certificate the identity made of a working key (Section 5.2) | its serial, 1 to 2^53 − 1 |

- **The identity also signs certificates and revocations (Section 10).** A certificate's own signature, and a revocation's, are verified against the identity key directly: neither is a signer, and neither is ranked.
- **A verifier takes the signer from the signature,** and MUST refuse a signing key of neither form, a bare working key among them. A certificate is checked against the identity the verifier holds for the address (Section 5.2) before the signature is verified under it.

### 5.1. What a verifier takes

- **The identity's own signature** on a prekey statement, a pass or a message, whatever revocation of the address's certificates the verifier holds. A revocation of certificates does not cover it (Section 10.2): only the revocation of the address ends it (Section 10.1).
- **A certificate above the revocation of the address's certificates the verifier holds** (Section 10.2), through a serial N: a verifier MUST refuse a signer that is a certificate of a serial at or below N, the serials compared as numbers. A verifier that holds none takes every certificate that passes Section 5.2.
- **Each party applies this by what it holds:** a reader at check 7, and never at check 5 (Section 12.3); a sender at its read of the recipient before every post (Section 12.2); a server by what it keeps of the address (Sections 8, 11.7, 11.9).

### 5.2. Certificates

A certificate is an OpenSSH user certificate, and a verifier MUST check every row of this table:

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Type | a user certificate |
| Certified key | the working key: of the type Section 4.1's table gives for the identity's type, held to that type's key checks, and never the identity key |
| Serial | a serial (Section 2.2) |
| Key id | exactly `dromas-cert-v1` |
| Principals | exactly one: the mailbox's address |
| Validity | `valid after` ≤ now < `valid before`, at the verifier's clock, in whole seconds, and each at or before `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z` |
| Critical options | none. A verifier MUST refuse a certificate with any (draft-ietf-sshm-cert-01 §2.1.1) |
| Extensions | ignored, each, but a verifier MUST refuse a certificate whose extensions are not in one encoding: each name once, in lexical order, and each value empty or one string that is not empty. A maker writes none |
| Reserved | ignored, whatever it holds. A maker writes it empty |
| Signed by | the key in the identity document, byte for byte, its signature in the one form of the key's type (Section 3.2) |

- **A certificate is checked at the verifier's clock, exactly, and only once the identity's signature on it has verified.** It holds from its `valid after` and has ended at its `valid before` (Section 2.2). A date past `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`, `ssh-keygen`'s `forever` among them, refuses it.
- **A verifier sets no bound on how long a certificate runs.** A server bounds what it takes (Section 11.7, step 6); a reader takes any certificate within its window.
- **The certified key is never the identity key.** SSHSIG does not sign its signing-key field, so a signature can be carried under any certificate of the key that made it: the identity's own signature on a statement, rank 0, wrapped in a certificate of the identity key above N, would otherwise rank at that certificate's serial, and be taken above the statements under certificates that it stands below (Section 5.3).
- **Every certificate MUST certify a new working key,** one no earlier certificate certified. A working key's signature under a certificate of serial s1 could otherwise be wrapped in a later certificate of the same key, s2, and taken past a revocation through s1. No verifier can check this: its maker keeps to it.
- **A maker dates a certificate from an hour before it makes it,** and makes it for as long as its holder chooses, up to the maximum of the mailbox's server (Section 11.18). With `ssh-keygen`, a certificate of `$DAYS` days and an hour, `-U` added for an identity in an agent:

      ssh-keygen -s identity -I dromas-cert-v1 -n "$A" -z "$SERIAL" -V "-1h:+${DAYS}d" -O clear work.pub

- **Serials.** The maker numbers a certificate by its own clock, in seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, or one above the highest serial it knows of for the mailbox when its clock gives nothing higher: the served certificate's, what the mailbox published or signed, and the highest serial the identity has revoked (Section 10.2), so always above the address's N. A verifier MUST NOT read a serial as a time, or bound it by its clock: it compares two serials, and the higher is later. Two certificates of one identity can share a serial (made in one second, or each one above the same serial); a verifier that meets two takes either, and keeps nothing of it beyond the serial.
- **Nothing may depend on a P-256 identity's signature having one set of bytes.** Beside (r, s) is (r, n − s) (Section 3.2), which anyone who has seen one can write: on a certificate it made, and on the statements, passes and messages it signs. A server takes a pass by a certificate only under exactly the certificate's bytes it has on record, and one that remembers passes takes a P-256 identity's pass in either form as one pass (Section 8).

### 5.3. Order

- **A mailbox's prekey statements are ordered by `(c, p)`:** `c` is the rank of the statement's signer and `p` the statement's own serial (Section 6). A statement is later than another if its signer ranks higher, at any prekey serial, or it has the same signer and a higher prekey serial; one by another certificate of the same serial is neither. So every statement under a certificate is later than every statement the identity signed, and statements go one way: once a statement under a certificate is taken, a statement the identity signs stands below it and is refused, at a server and at a sender. A server orders a mailbox's statements so (Section 11.9), and so does a sender, by what it has seen (Section 12.2).
- **What a later signer retires.** At the server, every statement by a signer of a lower rank (Section 11.9), and the pass of every certificate but the current statement's (Section 8); the identity's pass is still taken. At a sender, every statement by a signer of a lower rank. At a reader, nothing: a message is taken by its sender's identity, or under any certificate of it that the reader takes (Section 5.1) and that holds when the message is read.

## 6. The prekey statement

Five lines, signed by the mailbox's signer (Section 5), in the namespace `dromas-prekey-v1:<A>`:

```
dromas-prekey-v1
<A>
<serial>
<age recipient>
<not_after>
```

- **Serial:** a serial. Under one signer, each statement's is higher than the last's.
- **Key:** an age recipient of a type its Bech32 human-readable part names (BIP 173, as age writes a recipient: lowercase, its checksum valid, its data whole bytes, and with no limit on its length, as age has it): `age1pq` for `mlkem768x25519`, the one prekey type. A key whose X25519 half is of small order breaks the statement. A prekey type added later is an addition inside v1 (Section 14).
- **`not_after`:** a time. A client signs a statement to end 33 days after it makes it, or sooner, down to a day and three hours (Section 12.4). A server takes a statement that ends at most 33 days and an hour after its own clock reads.
- **A sender MUST NOT encrypt to a prekey past its `not_after`.** There is no grace period.
- **A sender MUST keep, for each mailbox, the latest `(c, p)` it has seen on the mailbox's statements, and refuse an earlier statement** (Section 5.3).
- **A sender MUST hold a statement to every other rule before its key's type.** A statement that passes every other rule and whose key is a well-formed Bech32 string whose human-readable part begins `age` and is not `age1pq`, X25519's `age` among them, is refused as `unsupported_prekey_type`, never as a statement that does not verify, and nothing is sealed or posted to it.

## 7. Sender key types

A mailbox declares the identity key types its client verifies, so that a sender of an optional type does not write to a mailbox that cannot read it.

- **With each prekey it publishes, a mailbox SHOULD declare every identity key type its client verifies,** in `sender_key_types`, a list of key type names, in its registration (Section 11.7) and in each renewal (Section 11.9). The read of the mailbox carries it (Section 11.8).
- **`ssh-ed25519` is taken by every mailbox, whatever it declared.** A mailbox that declared nothing takes `ssh-ed25519` senders only.
- **A sender whose identity's type is not on the recipient's list MUST NOT send,** and a server refuses the send, `403 sender_key_type` (Section 11.10, step 7).
- **The one entry `any`** says that the mailbox does not say which types its client verifies. A server then makes no check for that mailbox. A client declares `any` only when its owner tells it to.
- **The declaration is the current prekey's.** A renewal replaces it, with nothing if it carries none; an identical retry changes nothing.
- **It is not signed.** What a recipient takes is decided by what its client verifies (Section 12.3), never by this list.
- **A server keeps the names it knows and ignores the rest.**

## 8. The pass

A mailbox proves itself to its server, on every call it makes as itself, with a pass it signs for itself. The server issues nothing for it and stores nothing.

The pass is four lines, signed by the mailbox's signer (Section 5), in the namespace `dromas-pass-v1:<A>`:

```
dromas-pass-v1
<A>
<server name>
<not_after>
```

- **The server name** is the host of the mailbox's URL for its server, written as an origin is (RFC 6454 §6.2): lowercase, with no user information, and with its port only when the port is not the scheme's default. `https://dromas.dev:443` and `https://dromas.dev` name `dromas.dev`; `http://127.0.0.1:8080` names `127.0.0.1:8080`. A server MUST write the `Host` of a request the same way, and drop a port of 443 or 80 alike, so that checking a pass never depends on the scheme a request came by.
- **A client writes it as** `Authorization: dromas-pass address="<A>", not_after="<not_after>", signature="<base64 of the armoured signature>"`, in exactly that form, on one `Authorization` line. A request with two `Authorization` lines carries no pass.
- **A server reads it as RFC 9110 §11 lets a recipient read credentials:** the scheme in any ASCII case, then one space or more; the three parameters in any order, each name in any ASCII case and given once, and no other parameter; optional whitespace around each comma and each `=`, and empty list elements skipped (RFC 9110 §5.6.1.2); each value a token or a quoted-string, and a quoted-string holding a backslash refused. Each value is then held to its form: the address, a time, and the base64 of the signature. The signature is verified over the statement built from those values, never over the header's text. A server MUST refuse a value longer than the form a client writes with a signature of the largest bound any identity key type has (Section 3.2), whitespace included, `401 unauthorized`, before it hashes, parses or verifies it.
- **Lifetime.** A client signs a pass to end 10 minutes after it signs it. A server takes a pass that has not ended and ends at most an hour after its own clock reads.
- **A client keeps its pass for every call until it is about to end.** A client MUST NOT use a kept pass with more than 10 minutes left: its clock has gone back since it signed it. A server MAY remember a pass it has verified, by its values with the signature in its one form (Section 3.2): that is one pass, however the header wrote it. A P-256 identity's pass is one pass with s or with n − s, and a server that remembers passes MUST compare it with s taken as the lower of the two.
- **Which signer.** A server takes a pass by the mailbox's identity always, and a pass by a certificate only where it is exactly the certificate of the mailbox's current statement, the bytes it has on record, with one exception: a registration (Section 11.7) and a renewal (Section 11.9) take a pass by the certificate of the statement they bring. It takes a pass only for a name that is its own. The server reads a pass by its signer's form (Section 5).
- **Refusals,** each `401`: `certificate_revoked`, where the call takes a pass by the mailbox's current certificate and the identity has revoked it (Section 11.4, rule 1), or brings a statement under a certificate the identity revoked; otherwise `pass_expired`, if at the server's clock the pass has ended or ends more than an hour ahead, or its certificate has not begun or has ended; `certificate_not_current`, if the pass is by any certificate other than the one the call takes a pass by, or the certificate on record does not verify, with `certificate_serial` naming the certificate the call takes a pass by (the mailbox's current one, or the statement's a registration or a renewal brings), or the one a new statement must be above, wherever that is a certificate, and with none where that statement is the identity's; `unauthorized`, if there is no pass, or it is not this mailbox's, or not for this server, or does not verify.
- **A client that is refused a pass signs another and tries once more, and MUST NOT try more than once,** nor at all after a `certificate_revoked` that its own read of its mailbox shows to be final (Section 12.5). A pass refused twice for its time is the clock (Section 12.1).
- **The read of a mailbox (Section 11.8), the link page (Section 4.3) and the two revocation calls (Section 11.15) take no pass,** and a server reads none on them, whatever `Authorization` they carry.

## 9. Messages

### 9.1. The envelope

The envelope is one line of compact JSON, its LF included, and is what the sender signs. The server never sees it.

| Member | | |
|---|---|---|
| `v` | required | the integer `1` |
| `from` | required | the sender's address |
| `to` | required | the recipient's address |
| `sent_at` | required | a time: when this copy was posted (Section 12.2) |
| `msg_id` | required | a UUID as RFC 9562 §4 writes one (hex, hyphens between its 4, 2, 2, 2 and 6 octets), lowercase, of any version. A client makes a random one (version 4) once for each message and keeps it on every copy |
| `identity` | required | the sender's identity document, base64. `from` is its hash |
| `body` | required | the message's content: any JSON value, carried as that value. Its null is a value |
| `subject` | optional | a string |
| `in_reply_to` | optional | a string: the `msg_id` replied to |
| `supersedes` | optional | a string: a `msg_id` of the same sender that this message replaces. A stored message is never altered; the recipient decides |

- **An empty string in `subject`, `in_reply_to` or `supersedes` is the member left out,** and a writer leaves such a member out.
- **A sender MUST refuse an `in_reply_to` or `supersedes` that is not a `msg_id`.** A reader checks only that each is a string.
- **The line is compact UTF-8 JSON** with no line feed of its own. A sender writes it without escaping `<`, `>`, `&` or non-ASCII characters.
- **A sender MUST hold the envelope to the rules its reader holds it to** (Section 3.3, and Section 12.3, check 3; the body nested at most 31 deep, so the envelope at most 32), and MUST refuse one that breaks a rule whole, never repairing it, before the outbox keeps it. One that keeps them is written compact, its members in the order given and its strings and numbers the values given.
- **A reader takes any JSON text on the line that Section 3.3 takes,** whatever spelling the sender's encoder chose, and MUST read the members from the line exactly as it decrypted it.
- **`v` changes only for a breaking change,** and a reader MUST refuse a `v` it does not know.

### 9.2. The signed plaintext

The sender signs the envelope's line with its signer (Section 5), in the namespace `dromas-msg-v1:<recipient>`: with its identity,

    ssh-keygen -q -Y sign -n "dromas-msg-v1:$B" -f identity < P > P.sig

or with its working key under its certificate, `-f work-cert.pub`.

What is encrypted is, in order:

```
{"v":1,"from":"…","to":"…","sent_at":"…","msg_id":"…","identity":"…","body":"…"}
-----BEGIN SSH SIGNATURE-----
U1NIU0lH…
-----END SSH SIGNATURE-----
................
```

1. **Line 1 is the envelope,** and its bytes, LF included, are what is signed.
2. **Then the signature,** as `ssh-keygen` writes it, through its END line.
3. **Then padding,** to the end (Section 9.3).

A reader MUST take the parts apart so:

1. **The signature is verified over line 1 exactly as decrypted,** and the envelope's members are read from those same bytes, never from anything rebuilt.
2. **Each part has one place, and nothing is searched for.** Line 2 MUST be the signature's BEGIN line, ending in LF. The block ends at the first END line, which MUST be followed by LF; any other byte there, or none, refuses the message, and no later END line is looked for. What follows is never parsed and never shown.
3. **One signature, one identity:** it is verified against the identity the envelope carries, and the verdict is the verification's result alone.

The namespace binds the signature to its recipient: a message signed for one mailbox does not verify in another's namespace.

### 9.3. Padding

Every message is padded so that its ciphertext is a whole number of blocks.

- **A block** is the smallest power of two that is at least 1/16 of the ciphertext's size, and at least 1 KiB.
- **The padding is `.` bytes after the signature's END line, to the end,** as many as make the ciphertext the next whole number of blocks, and none for one already on a block. It is not signed.
- **For example,** a ciphertext of 40,000 bytes has a block of 4 KiB and is padded to 40,960; one of 70,000 has a block of 8 KiB and is padded to 73,728.
- **The ciphertext is what is measured.** An age file (C2SP age's format) of one native stanza and no other, of a plaintext of L bytes, is H + 16 + L + 16 × max(1, ⌈L / 65,536⌉) bytes: the header, H, 1,627 bytes for its `mlkem768x25519` stanza; the payload's nonce; the plaintext; and a tag for each 64 KiB chunk. A sender computes the padding from that before encrypting, and MUST refuse to send a file that is not the size it computed.
- **Padding is made at the seal,** for the prekey sealed to: a message sealed again is padded again.
- **A server does not check padding.** A size limit a server sets MUST be a whole number of its own blocks, as every power of two is, so that a message fits a limit padded exactly when it fits it bare.

### 9.4. Encryption

The signed plaintext and its padding are encrypted to the recipient's prekey with age (C2SP age), in the binary format, not armoured: `{ cat P P.sig; padding; } | age -r <recipient> > m.age`. The file has one `mlkem768x25519` stanza. A sender adds no other native stanza.

## 10. Revocation

### 10.1. Revocation of an address

A mailbox's identity can end its address for good, and nothing else can.

- **The statement is fixed text:** `dromas-revoke-v1`, LF, the address, LF. It has no date, no reason and no number: a verifier builds it from the address, and a copy signed at any time is the same statement.
- **It is signed by the identity key,** in the namespace `dromas-revoke-v1:<A>`, with the bare identity as the signing key. A working key's signature over the same statement, under a certificate of that identity, is not a revocation: a verifier's `allowed_signers` line names the identity's key with no `cert-authority`.
- **It reaches back, and nothing undoes it.** Once a verifier has verified a revocation, it takes nothing signed for that address, whenever it was signed, sends it nothing, and keeps the revocation for good. No later answer and no later record undoes it.

### 10.2. Revocation of certificates

The identity revokes every certificate it made up to and including a serial, and keeps its address.

- **The statement is three lines:** `dromas-revoke-certs-v1`, the address, a serial.
- **It is signed by the identity key,** in the namespace `dromas-revoke-certs-v1:<A>`, as `ssh-keygen -q -Y sign -n "dromas-revoke-certs-v1:$A" -f identity < statement > statement.sig`. A working key's signature is refused.
- **It revokes every certificate of the address whose serial is at or below its own, and the highest one verified stands.** It covers certificates only: the identity's own signature, on a prekey statement, a pass or a message, is taken whatever it says, and only the revocation of the address ends the identity (Sections 5.1, 10.1). A verifier keeps the highest it has verified. One through a lower serial changes nothing, whenever it arrives. There is no way to revoke fewer.
- **What a revoked certificate loses, at a verifier that holds the revocation:** a reader refuses a message signed under it, whenever it was signed (`certificate_revoked`); a sender refuses a prekey statement under it; a server takes no pass and no statement under it, and answers a send to a mailbox whose current statement is under it `409 prekey_expired`. A mailbox MUST NOT sign a message under a certificate it holds revoked. The address goes on.
- **A mailbox MUST NOT make a certificate its identity has revoked:** its next certificate is numbered above the highest serial it holds revoked or its server shows it (Section 5.2). One through 2^53 − 1 leaves no certificate to make.
- **How long one is kept is not fixed here.** Every certificate a server took that it covers ends within the server's maximum (Section 11.18) of its start.

### 10.3. The revocation record

A record carries what an identity revoked, and proves itself: anyone holding the address checks it with nothing else.

```json
{"type":"revocation_record","identity":"<base64 of D>","revocation_signature":"<base64>","revoked_certificates":"<base64>","revoked_certificates_signature":"<base64>"}
```

- **`type`** is `"revocation_record"`. Every writer writes it, a server in its answers (`api/openapi.yaml` requires it there) and a client in what it sends, keeps and prints. A reader takes a record without it, and MUST refuse one that names another type (a server with `400 bad_request`, `member` `type`).
- **`identity`** is the identity document, which MUST hash to the address and pass its key checks (Section 4.1).
- **`revocation_signature`**, if present, is the revocation of the address (Section 10.1), its armoured signature in base64.
- **`revoked_certificates`** with **`revoked_certificates_signature`**, if present, is the revocation of certificates (Section 10.2): its statement's three lines, and the armoured signature over them, each in base64. The statement MUST be exactly that form, its line 2 the address.
- **The members are in any order.** A record carries at least one of the two revocations.
- **A record is worth the same from a server or from a file.** A verifier rebuilds the revocation of the address from the address, holds the revocation of certificates to its form, and verifies each signature under the document's key.

## 11. The HTTP API

The shapes of every operation below are `api/openapi.yaml`'s. This section says what each means and what a server checks.

### 11.1. Transport

- **A client MUST call its server over `https`,** except a server on its own machine named by an address in `127.0.0.0/8` or by `[::1]`, which it MAY call over `http`. The name `localhost` is not such an address. A client MUST refuse a URL of any other form before sending anything, and MUST send a call to a loopback address, or to `localhost`, through no proxy.
- **A server SHOULD terminate its own TLS,** on hosts its operator runs, with no third party between a client and it: a pass is a bearer credential for its server (Section 8), so whatever terminates TLS is part of the server (Section 15.8).
- **A client MUST NOT follow a redirect.** The API redirects nowhere, so a `3xx` other than `304` is no answer. A pass and a read of a mailbox name an address, and neither is sent anywhere a server points.
- **Every API path is under `/v1/`.**

### 11.2. Requests and answers

- **Bodies.** A JSON body is read as Section 3.3 reads one. A send's body is bytes (Section 11.10).
- **Query parameters** are read as members are: a server MUST refuse a parameter its call does not take, or one given twice, `400 bad_request`, naming it in `member`. A send takes its `statement` (Section 11.10) and a list its `cursor` (Section 11.11); no other call takes one.
- **`Date`.** Every answer under `/v1/` carries `Date`, by the clock the server's checks read.
- **No caching.** Every answer under `/v1/` carries `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- **Compression.** The read of a mailbox (Section 11.8) MAY be answered with gzip (RFC 9110 §8.4.1.3), and only to a request whose `Accept-Encoding` takes it. A server MUST NOT compress any other answer: a list sets values senders chose beside the mailbox's own (BREACH, RFC 7457 §2.6).
- **`HEAD`** is answered on every route that answers `GET`, as that `GET` without content (RFC 9110 §9.3.2): the same status and header fields, its preconditions evaluated as the `GET`'s. A list's `HEAD` is a poll whatever its cursor, and neither spends the cursor nor hands out another. A message's `HEAD` is no fetch: it reads only whether the mailbox holds the message, spends nothing of new messages and marks nothing (Section 11.12), is one of the mailbox's calls, carries no `Content-Length`, and ignores a `Range`.
- **Preconditions.** Every call evaluates `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` as RFC 9110 §13.1.1 and §13.1.2 have an origin server evaluate them, where Section 11.4 places them. The target is what the path names. Only a list's first page (Section 11.11) and an ACL (Section 11.14) carry an `ETag`. A target that carries none matches no listed tag: where the target exists, `If-Match: *` is true and `If-None-Match: *` false; where it does not, `If-Match` is false whatever it lists, and `If-None-Match: *` true; a list of tags is false in `If-Match` and true in `If-None-Match` either way. `*` is read as `*` only as the whole value; otherwise the value is a list of entity-tags, each read through its closing quote, and a value of any other form, `*` among tags included, matches nothing. `If-Match` compares strongly and `If-None-Match` weakly. A false `If-Match` is `412 precondition_failed`; a false `If-None-Match` is `304` to a `GET` or a `HEAD`, and `412` to any other method. A write that carries `If-Match` or `If-None-Match: *` (a registration, a renewal, a revocation, an ACL, an adopt, a leave) writes only while they still hold, and is otherwise `409 mailbox_changed`, with nothing changed; a registration that meets a mailbox registered meanwhile is answered as one of a registered mailbox is, and an ack that meets its message acked meanwhile `404 no_such_message`. The conditions on dates are not evaluated, and no answer carries `Last-Modified`. `If-Range` is read only beside a fetch's `Range`, and is false (Section 11.12).
- **An unknown route** is answered with the router's plain `404` or `405`, with no code, or, past a limit, `429 rate_limited` as any call is. A client reads a plain `404` or `405` as a route that server does not offer, and a `404` with a code as that code.
- **A body that does not arrive in time** is `408 request_timeout`. **A server that cannot complete a request,** or is not ready to answer, says so, `503 unavailable` with `Retry-After`, rather than answer wrong. A client takes any other `5xx` as the same failure, with no wait given.

### 11.3. Errors

- **Every error body is RFC 9457 Problem Details** (`application/problem+json`), in AEP-193's form: `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `code`, `hint`, and a member of its own for each value the error carries. Every value `detail` names is also one of those members.
- **`type`** is `tag:dromas.dev,2026-10-26:errors/<code>` (RFC 4151), the same at every server. It resolves to nothing.
- **A `code` is one of the closed list `api/openapi.yaml` gives, under the status it gives, beside its own `type`.** A code a client does not know, or one under another status, or beside another `type`, is no code: a client takes no branch on it and shows none of it, only the status. A member that breaks its type makes the body no answer (Section 3.3).
- **A client MUST NOT show `detail`, `hint`, `title`, or any other text a server sent** (a status line, a header or trailer line, a `Location`, a list's cursor in a path). They are a server's words, for a person reading the body. A client says what a code means in its own words, with the members it has checked to their types, and shows a string member only once it has checked it to a value it knows. A call with no answer the client can read is named by its method and path, never its query. A `hint` names a fix as a client command, never a shell line.
- **A client reads `code`, the members, `Retry-After` and `Date` on every answer that is not `2xx`.**
- **`401`** carries `WWW-Authenticate` with the scheme `dromas-pass` (Section 8).
- **`Retry-After`,** on a `429` and a `503`, and on every list answer (Section 11.11), is delay-seconds, digits alone. A client reads an HTTP-date there as no wait.
- **A code names what a client does about the error:** one call that can fail for causes a client meets differently has a code for each.

What each code means, and what a client does on it:

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `bad_request` | not a JSON text Section 3.3 takes; a member or query parameter missing, unknown, given twice, or holding a value its call does not take. `member` names it |
| 400 | `bad_address` | an address in the path that is not 77 characters of lowercase base32 |
| 400 | `bad_encoding` | a byte member that is not base64 in its one encoding |
| 400 | `identity_mismatch` | an identity document that does not hash to the address, or breaks its form (Section 4.1) |
| 400 | `unsupported_key_type` | an identity of a key type this protocol does not define, or this server does not register; `key_types` lists what it registers |
| 400 | `bad_key` | an identity key that fails its type's key checks; a malformed or badly signed prekey statement or certificate |
| 400 | `prekey_not_new` | a prekey equal to the current one or a retired one the server keeps (Section 11.9) |
| 400 | `prekey_time` | at the server's clock, a certificate that has not begun or has ended, or a statement that has ended or ends more than 33 days and an hour ahead: nearly always the client's clock |
| 400 | `certificate_too_long` | a certificate that runs longer than the server takes (Section 11.7, step 6); `max_certificate_lifetime` is the most it takes |
| 400 | `not_age` | a send's body that is not an age file |
| 400 | `wrong_recipient_type` | a send's age file without exactly one native stanza of the current prekey's type (Section 11.10, step 7) |
| 400 | `bad_revocation` | a revocation whose signature is not the identity's over its statement (Section 11.15) |
| 401 | `unauthorized`, `pass_expired`, `certificate_not_current`, `certificate_revoked` | the pass refused (Section 8). `certificate_serial` names the certificate on `certificate_not_current`, where the signer it names is one |
| 403 | `unknown_sender` | the mailbox a send's pass names is not registered |
| 403 | `sender_revoked` | the sending mailbox is revoked |
| 403 | `sender_not_allowed` | the recipient's ACL does not admit the sender (Section 11.14): final for the message |
| 403 | `sender_key_type` | the recipient's client does not verify the sender's identity key type (Section 7); `key_type` names it |
| 403 | `adopt_key_refused` | an adopt key this server did not make, or that is spent, expired or revoked (Section 11.16) |
| 404 | `no_such_mailbox` | the mailbox was never registered, or is forgotten |
| 404 | `no_such_message` | the message was acked or has expired: it is gone |
| 404 | `not_revoked` | the server holds no revocation of the address (Section 11.15) |
| 408 | `request_timeout` | the body did not arrive in time: send it again |
| 409 | `conflict` | what is held is newer, or other: a registration that is not an identical retry; a renewal by the current signer at a prekey serial not higher (`prekey_serial` names the serial it must pass); a revocation of certificates through a serial lower than the one held (`through` names the one held) |
| 409 | `mailbox_changed` | the mailbox changed while the request was handled, or a condition it carried no longer held at its write: send it again as it is |
| 409 | `stale_prekey` | a newer prekey exists: read the mailbox again and seal the same envelope |
| 409 | `prekey_expired` | the recipient's prekey has ended, or its signer is revoked: its owner must renew |
| 410 | `revoked` | the address is revoked, for good; `record` carries the server's record of it (Section 10.3), which a client checks (Section 12.5) |
| 410 | `version_retired` | the server no longer takes the version the request names (Section 11.17); `min_version`, when the server sets a floor, is the lowest it takes |
| 412 | `precondition_failed` | a precondition was false (Section 11.2) |
| 413 | `too_large` | a body or ciphertext over its cap, or an ACL with more entries than the server takes; `limit` gives the cap |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | past a limit (Section 11.5); `subject`, `quota_id`, and for a number a day `limit` |
| 429 | `fetch_paced`, `refetch_spent` | the mailbox's fetches are paced (Section 11.12) |
| 429 | `mailbox_full` | the mailbox holds as many messages as it may; `count`, how many it holds, as its list counts them |
| 429 | `mailbox_busy` | the mailbox has taken as many new messages as it takes for now |
| 503 | `unavailable` | the server is not ready to answer |

Every `429` carries `Retry-After`.

### 11.4. The order of refusals

Which refusal a server answers first is its own, but for four rules. Otherwise, where a request fails several checks, a server answers the one it finds first, and a client acts on whichever comes; the steps of Sections 11.7 and 11.10 are numbered to be cited, not to order them.

0. **A retired version comes before everything** (Section 11.17): such a request is answered `410 version_retired` with nothing of it read, its pass included, and counts against nothing but the address's `requests`.
1. **A mailbox's state comes before any pass.** A call answers the state of the mailbox whose pass it carries, and a read of a mailbox the state of the mailbox it reads, before any pass is judged: a call with a mailbox's own pass, `404 no_such_mailbox` for a mailbox unknown, `410 revoked`, and `401 certificate_revoked` where it takes a pass by the mailbox's current certificate and the identity has revoked it; a send, of its sender, `403 unknown_sender`, `403 sender_revoked` and `401 certificate_revoked`; the read of a mailbox, `404 no_such_mailbox` or `410 revoked` with its record; the read of revocations, `404 not_revoked` or `200` with the record. So a mailbox learns its own state whatever pass it carries.
2. **What could change nothing is answered from what is kept.** A registration of a mailbox the server holds is answered from its record (Section 11.7, step 5), and an identical retry of it, or of a renewal, is `200 {}`; a revocation of an address the server holds revoked, or of certificates through a serial no higher than the one held, is answered from what is held (Section 11.15); a send of a ciphertext its recipient holds unacked gets the receipt it holds, whatever has changed at that mailbox since (Section 11.10, step 6). None of them is refused by a count of what it would make new. The budgets that bound any call may still defer one with a `429`: the address's `requests` and `misses`, and the mailbox's `calls`.
3. **Preconditions are evaluated once the call knows its target's state** (by its route, its method, its pass where it takes one, and the read of its target) **and before it acts** (RFC 9110 §13.2.1, §13.2.2). What is refused before that point is answered as without them. After it, a false one is a call that does nothing but count: a list's is a poll, a fetch's or an ack's one of the mailbox's calls, and it takes no cursor and no new message, marks nothing fetched and writes nothing. A send evaluates them before its dedupe (Section 11.10, step 6).

### 11.5. Limits

What a server limits, and by how much, is its own: no limit's value is part of the protocol, and a server may add limits. A client meets a limit as a `429` with `Retry-After`, which it waits out and then retries, unless the code says otherwise. Every server keeps these promises:

- **A drain of a full mailbox always completes:** its list pages are never refused, and its fetches may be paced, each `429 fetch_paced` saying when to go on, never stopped for good.
- **A mailbox's counts are spent only** by calls that carried its pass, by messages sent to it, and by its identity's raises of the revocation of certificates. An address's counts are spent only by calls from it.
- **The identity's acts are counted apart from what a working key can spend:** a renewal by a later signer apart from one by the current signer, and one made while the current signer is revoked not at all (Section 11.9); a raise of the revocation of certificates on a count of its own; the revocation of an address against no mailbox (Section 11.15). So a holder of a taken working key cannot keep the identity from revoking that key's certificate.

**Who a call is counted against.** A call with a mailbox's pass is counted against that mailbox. A call with none is counted against the IPv4 address or the IPv6 /64 it comes from; a server MAY also count by a wider range. The read of a mailbox is counted against its address whatever it carries. A check that fails, or a call that names no mailbox, is counted against its address. No caller is exempt.

**How a refusal names its limit.** A limit without a code of its own (`fetch_paced`, `refetch_spent`, `mailbox_busy`, `mailbox_full`) is `429 rate_limited`, with whom it was counted against in `subject` (`mailbox`, or `ip`) and which limit in `quota_id`. Where one call would spend several limits, `Retry-After` is the time when every limit the server can read without doing the call's work lets the same call through (RFC 8555 §6.6), and the name is that limit's; a limit behind that work, a read of storage or a signature check, can still refuse the call once that wait is over. A send's number a day is behind its dedupe, so a send past its calls is told the calls' wait. **A number a day** is a budget of that many, refilled one at a time, evenly over the day, for each mailbox: `limit` gives the number.

| `quota_id` | `subject` | Counts |
|---|---|---|
| `polls` | `mailbox` | its polls: each list without a cursor, a `304` and a `412` among them, and each list with a cursor that is not a continuation (Section 11.11) |
| `pages` | `mailbox` | its continuations, sized so that a full mailbox always drains |
| `calls` | `mailbox` | its other calls with its pass, a send, a renewal and an identical retry of its registration among them |
| `sends` | `mailbox` | its sends, a number a day, counted only for sends that carried its pass |
| `renewals` | `mailbox` | its renewals by its current signer, a number a day |
| `certificates` | `mailbox` | its renewals by a later signer, a number a day, but for one made while its current signer is revoked |
| `certificate_revocations` | `mailbox` | its identity's raises of the revocation of certificates, a number a day |
| `registrations` | `ip` | registrations from an IPv4 address or IPv6 /64, and what a server counts as one (Section 11.15) |
| `registrations_range` | `ip` | the same, from an IPv6 /48 |
| `misses` | `ip` | calls that named no mailbox, or carried nothing that verified |
| `sends_before_pass` | `ip` | sends, counted before their pass is read |
| `requests` | `ip` | every request but one that carries a pass the server has already verified, on a call that takes it: registrations, renewals and requests no route matches among them |

A server's limit outside these names none in `quota_id`.

### 11.6. Mailbox states

Every call names a mailbox, and this is what each does in each state.

| State | Register `PUT /v1/<A>` | Renew `PUT /v1/<A>/prekey` | A call with the mailbox's pass | Revoke `PUT /v1/<A>/revocations` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **unknown** (never registered, or forgotten) | → `active`, `201` | `404 no_such_mailbox` | `404 no_such_mailbox` | kept: of the address → `revoked`, `201`; of certificates, `200`, and the address stays unknown |
| **active** | an identical retry, `200`; otherwise `409 conflict` | `200`, stays `active` | served | of the address → `revoked`, `201`, its messages deleted; of certificates, `200` |
| **revoked** | `410 revoked` | `410 revoked` | `410 revoked` | `410 revoked`, answered from the record |

- **A send answers its sender's state** as `403 unknown_sender` or `403 sender_revoked` (Section 11.10, step 1), and its recipient's as this table does.
- **There is no delete of a mailbox.** A mailbox leaves a server for good by its identity's revocation, pauses with its ACL (Section 11.14), and is forgotten once it stops renewing.
- **There is no pending state:** a registration carries a pass minutes old, so a mailbox is active from its first call.
- **A mailbox is forgotten once nothing valid for it is left** (Section 13): it has stopped renewing, and the date Section 13 keeps it until has passed. It is then unknown, and registers anew, its ACL and its account gone. What its identity revoked is kept.
- **A replay** of a request that took effect, byte for byte, gets `200` and the same result, and a conflicting one `409 conflict`; a send's is answered as Section 11.10, step 6, answers it.

### 11.7. Register

`PUT /v1/<A>` with `identity`, `prekey` and `prekey_signature` (the exact bytes of each, base64) and `sender_key_types` if the mailbox declares any, carrying a pass by the signer of that prekey statement. The mailbox is in use at once.

The server checks:

1. The address in the path is 77 characters of lowercase base32 → otherwise `bad_address`.
2. The body has exactly those members → otherwise `bad_request`, naming the member.
3. `identity` hashes to the address and has the form of an identity document (Section 4.1) → otherwise `identity_mismatch`.
4. **The key's type and the key.** A type this protocol does not define → `unsupported_key_type`. The key in its one encoding → otherwise `identity_mismatch`. The type's key checks → otherwise `bad_key`. A server registers `ssh-ed25519` and whichever other defined types its operator chooses, and answers the rest `unsupported_key_type`, naming its list.
5. **A registration never changes a registered mailbox.** One the server holds is answered from its record: an active mailbox, and the request byte-identical to its current identity, prekey statement and signature → `200 {}` once its pass (step 7) is verified, or `401 certificate_revoked` if the identity has revoked the certificate of that statement; anything else → `409 conflict`. A revoked address → `410 revoked` with its record, mailbox or none. Any other registration is counted against its address (Section 11.5, `registrations`).
6. **The prekey statement and its signer:** the statement's form (Section 6); line 2 is the address; a valid age recipient of the prekey type on line 4, its X25519 half not of small order; the signer that identity, or a certificate of it in every rule of Section 5.2; the namespace `dromas-prekey-v1:<A>`; the statement's `not_after` after now and at most 33 days and an hour after now → otherwise `bad_key`, or `prekey_time` where what fails is the certificate's time or the statement's `not_after`. A certificate that runs longer than the server's maximum (Section 11.18), `valid before` less `valid after`, unless it is the certificate of the mailbox's current statement → `400 certificate_too_long`. A certificate the identity revoked, by what the server keeps of the address (Section 5.1) → `401 certificate_revoked`.
7. **The pass** (Section 8): this mailbox's, for this server, not ended, by the identity or by the signer of step 6 → otherwise a `401`. The signer shows the identity chose this key, and a pass minutes old shows its holder is present: nobody can register an identity they do not hold, and a statement that leaked cannot be registered by whoever found it.
8. **A new mailbox** is stored `active` → `201 {}`. A mailbox registered meanwhile by another request is answered as step 5 answers.
9. **The server keeps the statement's signer:** the identity, or the certificate and its serial. It takes a pass by the identity, or by that certificate where the signer is one (Section 8), and a later statement only by that signer or by one of a higher rank (Section 5.3).

### 11.8. Read a mailbox

`GET /v1/<A>`, with no pass: everything a sender needs before it posts, and everything a mailbox knows of itself at its server.

- **An active mailbox** → `200` with `identity`, `prekey` and `prekey_signature`, `sender_key_types` if the mailbox declared any, and `revoked_certificates` with `revoked_certificates_signature` if the server holds a revocation of its certificates.
- **An unknown address** → `404 no_such_mailbox`, whatever its identity has revoked of its certificates (the read of revocations serves that: Section 11.15).
- **A revoked address** → `410 revoked`, with the record in `record`.
- **The read takes no pass.** It is public: a server counts it against the address it comes from, whatever `Authorization` it carries, and reads no pass on it. A client sends none on it.

### 11.9. Renew the prekey

`PUT /v1/<A>/prekey` with `prekey` and `prekey_signature`, and `sender_key_types` if the mailbox declares any, carrying a pass by that statement's signer or by the identity. Its authority is a statement later than the current one, signed by the identity or by a working key the identity certified: no pass by the mailbox's current signer is needed, so a mailbox that lost its working key comes back by a renewal under a new certificate, and a mailbox moves to a new certificate this way, its first among them.

- **An identical retry** is answered from the record: `200 {}` once its pass is verified, or `401 certificate_revoked` while the mailbox's current signer is revoked.
- **Any other statement** is verified as at registration (Section 11.7, steps 6 and 7) and MUST be later than the current one by `(c, p)` (Section 5.3): by a signer of a higher rank, at any prekey serial, or by the current signer at a higher prekey serial. By the current signer at a prekey serial not higher → `409 conflict`, `prekey_serial` naming the serial it must pass. By a signer of a lower rank, or another certificate of the current serial → `401 certificate_not_current`, `certificate_serial` naming the one it must be above where that is a certificate. Under a certificate the identity revoked → `401 certificate_revoked`.
- **A key equal to the current one, or to a retired one the server keeps,** → `400 prekey_not_new`. A server keeps the newest of a mailbox's retired prekeys (how many is its own), each until its statement's `not_after`, only for this check.
- **On success** the new prekey becomes current and its signer the mailbox's current one, so no pass by an earlier signer is taken again; its declaration (Section 7) is the mailbox's from then on; the answer is `200 {}`.
- **Counting** (Section 11.5): a renewal by the current signer spends `renewals`, one by a later signer `certificates`, and one while the current signer is revoked neither, nor any of the mailbox's calls. Past either, `429 rate_limited` naming it. An identical retry spends neither.
- **A mailbox the server has forgotten** → `404 no_such_mailbox` (Section 12.4).

### 11.10. Send

`POST /v1/<B>/messages?statement=<hash>`, its body the age file's exact bytes (`Content-Type: application/octet-stream`), carrying the sender's pass → `201` with `id`, `received_at` and `expires_at`, and `Location: /v1/<B>/messages/<id>`. The sender is the mailbox the pass names. `statement` is REQUIRED, and names the prekey statement the file is sealed to: the SHA-256 of the statement's bytes as the read of `B` served them (Section 11.8), never of its signature, in 64 lowercase hex digits. Another encoding of the same signature (Section 5.2) leaves it the same.

- **A server reads the body as bytes, whatever its `Content-Type` says.**
- **A ciphertext is at most 16 MiB (16,777,216 bytes).** A server's caps on it, an account's among them, are at most that, and every reader takes a ciphertext of any size up to it, so a message one server takes, every reader reads. A larger one is a new version of the protocol.
- **The server checks no signature on a message:** there is none for it to see. What it holds a sender to is the pass.

The server checks, and only step 9 stores anything. Every count is taken before the work it guards and given back if that work does not happen.

1. **Who is sending: the pass** (Section 8), read for the mailbox it names. Before it, the address's `sends_before_pass`. The mailbox it names unknown → `403 unknown_sender`; revoked → `403 sender_revoked`. Then the pass's own refusals, and the sender's `calls` (Section 11.5), which every send spends, a retry included.
2. **The path and the query.** `<B>` is an address → otherwise `bad_address`. `statement` is given once, 64 characters of `0`–`9` and `a`–`f`, and no other parameter is → otherwise `bad_request`, naming the parameter.
3. **The body's size:** at most the sender's cap → otherwise `413 too_large` with the cap in `limit`, from the `Content-Length` before anything is read, or as it reads.
4. **It is an age file** → otherwise `not_age`, an empty body included.
5. **`B` is active:** unknown → `404 no_such_mailbox`; revoked → `410 revoked`.
6. **Dedupe, while the message is live:** the id is the ciphertext's SHA-256. `B` holding that id unacked, from any sender → `200` with the receipt it holds, whatever has changed at `B` since. Nothing of a message is kept once it is acked or has expired: the same bytes sent after that are a new message, stored and counted as any send is, which a reader that took them once skips or refuses (Section 12.3, check 8).
7. **`B` takes new messages, on this prekey, from this sender.** `B`'s current prekey past its `not_after`, or by a signer `B`'s identity has revoked → `409 prekey_expired`. A sender whose identity is not `ssh-ed25519`, to a `B` that declared neither that type nor `any` (Section 7) → `403 sender_key_type`. `statement` not the hash of `B`'s current statement → `409 stale_prekey`. **Exactly one native stanza** (`mlkem768x25519`) of the current prekey's type; a stanza whose type matches `^[!-~]{1,8}-grease$` with at most 4 arguments is ignored, as age has a reader ignore a stanza it does not recognise, and its body is bounded by nothing but the message cap → otherwise `wrong_recipient_type`. Which key the file is sealed to cannot be checked.
8. **Quotas, counted only for sends that carried their sender's pass.** `B`'s ACL does not admit the sender → `403 sender_not_allowed`, one code and one wording whether the sender is denied or only not allowed. The sender's `sends` → `429 rate_limited`. `B`'s messages at their cap → `429 mailbox_full`. The new messages `B` takes, from every sender together, past its budget → `429 mailbox_busy`; a retry spends none. `mailbox_full` carries a `Retry-After` of the poll interval, and `mailbox_busy` the time until `B` takes another.
9. **Store it** (Section 13) → `201`. A concurrent send of the same ciphertext that got there first is answered as step 6 does. Any other failure is `503 unavailable`, and the sender posts the message again from its outbox.

### 11.11. List

`GET /v1/<B>/messages`, with the mailbox's pass → `200` with `count`, `messages` and `next_cursor`, and `Retry-After`.

- **`count`** is every live message in the mailbox; **`messages`** is one page of up to 50 entries, oldest first by `received_at`, each its `id`, `size` (its ciphertext's length, at most 16 MiB), `received_at` and `expires_at`, and no sender; **`next_cursor`** is null after the last page. An empty mailbox is `{"count":0,"messages":[],"next_cursor":null}`.
- **A cursor is opaque** and is one or more of `A`–`Z`, `a`–`z`, `0`–`9`, `-` and `_` (AEP-158). The next list carries it as `?cursor=` as it is.
- **`Retry-After` on every list answer, a `304` included, is the server's poll interval,** in seconds.
- **A first page carries an `ETag`,** a strong validator of the page's body, which changes with any message that enters or leaves the page or the count. A page after the first carries none.
- **`If-None-Match`** that matches the first page's tag is `304`, with its `ETag`, its `Retry-After` and no body. A list with a cursor is `304` only to `If-None-Match: *`. **`If-Match`** that is false is `412 precondition_failed`.
- **Every poll is counted** (`polls`), a `304` and a `412` included: a mailbox that polls faster than its budget is refused `429`, never answered `304`.
- **A list with a cursor is a continuation** only if it is a `GET` whose preconditions hold, the mailbox holds messages after the cursor, and the cursor is the `next_cursor` the server handed the mailbox last. A continuation spends `pages`. Only a `GET`'s `200` spends the cursor it carries and hands out the next; a false precondition, a refusal or a `HEAD` leaves the mailbox holding the cursor it was handed. Any other cursor the server can read is answered all the same and counted as a poll, and with nothing after it the page is empty.
- **The server checks:** `<B>` an address → otherwise `400 bad_address`; the parameters `cursor` and `wait` alone, each at most once, `cursor` of the form above and one the server can read as a cursor it makes, `wait` delay-seconds, digits alone, and never both on one list → otherwise `400 bad_request`, naming it.
- **A first page MAY be held: a long poll.** A list without a cursor MAY carry `wait`, a number of seconds. Where its `If-None-Match` would make it `304`, the server holds the answer until the first page's tag no longer matches it, then answers the page as any list is answered, or until the wait has passed, then answers the `304`. A server holds a list for at most a time of its own, which is no part of the protocol, MAY answer the `304` sooner, and answers it at once when it stops serving. A list whose `If-None-Match` would not make it `304`, or whose `wait` is `0`, is answered at once. A held list is one poll, counted when it arrives (Section 11.5).
- **Lists are eventually consistent:** a list may show a just-acked message, or miss a just-stored one, for a moment.

### 11.12. Fetch

`GET /v1/<B>/messages/<id>`, with the mailbox's pass → `200`, `application/octet-stream`, the ciphertext's exact bytes with a `Content-Length`, and nothing else. A message that is gone → `404 no_such_message`.

- **Ranges.** `Range: bytes=N-`, one open-ended range whose N is below the ciphertext's length, is answered `206 Partial Content` with the bytes from N to the end and `Content-Range: bytes N-<last>/<length>`, each number in digits with no leading zero. The unit `bytes` is read in any ASCII case. Any other `Range` (several ranges, a closed one, a suffix, N at or past the length, another unit), or one beside an `If-Range`, gets the whole body, `200`. No answer is `416`.
- **A fetch carries no validator.** A message's id is its ciphertext's SHA-256, so the bytes under an id never change.
- **Counting.** A message's first fetch spends the mailbox's budget of new messages taken out; past it, `429 fetch_paced`. A fetch of a message the mailbox has fetched before spends an allowance the size of its poll budget, the mailbox's alone and apart from its polls; past it, `429 refetch_spent`. Each carries `Retry-After`. A ranged fetch is counted as any fetch is.
- **Bodies are served by the API itself, never by a redirect.**

### 11.13. Ack

`DELETE /v1/<B>/messages/<id>`, with the mailbox's pass → `204`. It deletes the message, and the server keeps nothing of it (Section 13). A message that is gone → `404 no_such_message`. Reading does not delete.

### 11.14. ACL

A mailbox's ACL is whom its server takes the mailbox's messages from.

- **Semantics.** A mailbox with no ACL takes messages from everyone. With one, `deny` is checked first, then `allow`, and a sender matched by neither is refused, `403 sender_not_allowed`.
- **`PUT /v1/<B>/acl`,** with the pass, replaces it whole with `allow` and `deny`. Each entry is an address, or `*`, which matches every address; there is no other pattern, and repeats are taken once. `allow` is REQUIRED (`["*"]` is everyone and `[]` nobody): a document without it is `400 bad_request`. `deny` may be left out, for none. More entries, in both lists together, than the server takes is `413 too_large`. A server MUST NOT take more than 10,000, and MAY take fewer. The answer is `200` with the ACL as held, `*` first and then each address once in ascending order of its 48 bytes (not of its text, whose alphabet puts `2`–`7` after `z`), and no `ETag`.
- **`GET /v1/<B>/acl`,** with the pass, answers the ACL as held, in that order, with its `ETag`, a strong validator that changes whenever the lists change. A mailbox with none answers `{"allow":["*"],"deny":[]}`, and has a tag too. A client MUST treat an ACL answer holding more than 10,000 entries, in both lists together, as an answer that breaks its form. There is no `DELETE`.
- **A `PUT` MAY carry `If-Match`,** so that it replaces only the ACL its writer read: compared strongly with the tag of the ACL held now, a mailbox with none included. `If-None-Match: *`, or one naming the ACL's tag, is false, since a mailbox always has an ACL. A `PUT` without a precondition replaces whatever is held.
- **It deletes no message:** a change refuses later sends only, and what the mailbox holds stays until it is acked or expires. A send that passed the check while the ACL changed may still be stored after it.
- **A mailbox pauses with it:** `{"allow":[],"deny":["*"]}` refuses every sender.
- **It is not signed.** Only its mailbox reads it, and only the server acts on it.

### 11.15. Revocations

Neither call takes a pass.

- **`PUT /v1/<A>/revocations`** with a record (Section 10.3). The server verifies it as a client does, and keeps what verifies for good, with a mailbox at the address or none.
  - **A revocation of the address** → `201 {}`: a mailbox at the address is revoked for good, and its messages and its record are deleted.
  - **A revocation of certificates** → `200 {}`, and so does one through the same serial again; one through a lower serial than the one held → `409 conflict` (RFC 9110 §9.3.4), `through` naming the one held.
  - **Both in one body:** a revocation of certificates no higher than the one held changes nothing, whether or not it verifies, and the address's revocation is kept once it verifies (`201`). Any other part that does not verify refuses the body whole, and nothing in it is kept.
  - **An address already revoked** → `410 revoked` with the record.
  - A document that does not hash to the address → `400 identity_mismatch`; a signature that does not verify → `400 bad_revocation`.
  - **A revocation of an address is counted against no mailbox:** a server counts it against its caller's address, and MAY count one for an address it holds nothing of as a registration (`registrations`).
  - **A record for an address with no mailbox binds a later registration:** `410 revoked` while the address is revoked, and no certificate the identity revoked is taken.
- **`GET /v1/<A>/revocations`** → `200` with the record the server holds of the address, with a mailbox there or none, or `404 not_revoked`.

### 11.16. Accounts

A mailbox may belong to one account at its server. The protocol fixes how a mailbox joins and leaves one; what an account does is the server's own, within Section 11.5's promises. A server without accounts does not offer these routes.

- **`PUT /v1/<A>/account`,** with the pass, with `key`, an adopt key → `200` with `account`, the account's id. One use of the key is spent, unless the mailbox is already in that account. A mailbox in another account moves.
- **`DELETE /v1/<A>/account`,** with the pass → `204`, in an account or not. An account can drop a mailbox from its side too.
- **Joining or leaving changes nothing about the mailbox's messages.**
- **An adopt key** is `dra1_` followed by base64url without padding (RFC 4648 §5), at most 1,024 bytes in all. What it encodes is the server's own: a client holds a key to that form and reads nothing else of it, and MUST NOT take one as a command-line argument, where process lists and transcripts keep it. A key this server did not make, or that is spent, expired or revoked → `403 adopt_key_refused`.
- **An account id** is 1 to 32 of `a`–`z`, `0`–`9` and `-`.
- **An account's caps on a ciphertext** stay at most 16 MiB.

### 11.17. Versions

- **Every request names the version of the client that makes it,** in `Dromas-Version`: the version of its release as SemVer 2.0.0 writes one ([SemVer] §2, §9), `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and an optional pre-release, with no `v` and no build metadata. A client's major and minor are the protocol's that it implements, and a major of `0` is a release before version 1 is declared. A request without the field, or with a value of another form, is read as version `0.0.0`.
- **A server's version policy** is its own, in four parts: a floor, the versions it deems deprecated from a date (its deprecations), the versions it has scheduled to stop taking (its sunsets), and the latest version it names, if it names one. A version in the policy is written `MAJOR.MINOR` or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A deprecation or a sunset is a date and either `below` a version, which covers every version SemVer orders before it (a version written `MAJOR.MINOR` stands there for `MAJOR.MINOR.0`), or `version`, which covers every version whose major, minor and, where it is written, patch are its own. A server MUST NOT schedule a sunset earlier than a deprecation of the same `below` or `version` (RFC 9745 §4).
- **`Deprecation`.** An answer under `/v1/` to a request whose version a deprecation covers carries `Deprecation` (RFC 9745) as RFC 9745 §2.1 writes it, a Date (RFC 9651 §3.3.7), `@` and the date's Unix time in seconds: the earliest date of the deprecations that cover it. A date passed says the version is deprecated, and one to come that it will be then. Its scope is the version the request names, on every route under `/v1/`, wider than the resource RFC 9745 §2.2 gives the field by default. No other answer carries it, and no answer carries a `deprecation` link (RFC 9745 §3): a URL is a server's text, which a client never shows (Section 11.3).
- **`Sunset`.** An answer under `/v1/` to a request whose version a sunset covers carries `Sunset` (RFC 8594), with the same scope: the earliest date of the sunsets that cover it. No other answer carries it.
- **A retired version.** A request whose version is below the floor, or covered by a sunset whose date has passed at the server's clock, is answered `410 version_retired`, with `min_version` where the server sets a floor (Section 11.4, rule 0). `GET /v1/` takes every version.
- **A client reads `Deprecation` on every answer as a Date, `@` and an Integer, an optional `-` and 1 to 15 digits (RFC 9651 §3.3.1, §3.3.7), and `Sunset` as an HTTP-date (RFC 9110 §5.6.7), and nothing more:** a value of any other form is none, and neither is shown as the server's words (Section 11.3). A client tells its reader of a deprecation and of a sunset of its own version, each with its date, on every command that meets one.
- **The latest version.** A client SHOULD read the server's document (Section 11.18) at most once a day, and compares its own version with the document's `latest_version` in the parts that writes, from the major on: where `latest_version`'s is higher in one of them, it SHOULD tell its reader an upgrade is available; where the two are equal in every part `latest_version` writes, it MUST NOT, nor where its own is the higher: a client may be released before its server names that release.

### 11.18. The server's document

`GET /v1/` takes no pass and answers the server's version policy and the capabilities it serves, the same to every caller:

- **`min_version`** is the floor, when the server sets one.
- **`latest_version`** is the latest version the server names, when it names one.
- **`deprecations`** lists each deprecation as `below` or `version`, and `at`, its date, a time (Section 2.2).
- **`sunsets`** lists each scheduled sunset the same way. A sunset whose date has passed stays until the server raises its floor past it.
- **`max_certificate_lifetime`** is the longest a certificate the server takes may run, `valid before` less `valid after`, in seconds (Section 11.7, step 6). It is more than the TTL and an hour.
- **`capabilities`** lists each capability of version 1 the server serves, by `name`. A name is 1 to 64 of `a`–`z`, `0`–`9` and `_`, beginning with a letter, and is defined in this section. A client ignores a name it does not know, and never uses a capability the server does not list. This version defines none.

A server answers at most 64 deprecations, 64 sunsets and 64 capabilities, and a client reads no more: a document with more, or with a sunset earlier than a deprecation of the same `below` or `version`, breaks its form.

## 12. Clients

### 12.1. Keys and what a client keeps

- **A mailbox's keys and state are in a directory only its owner can read** (0700, or the system's own equivalent where it has no modes), and never the working directory.
- **The identity key** is a plain OpenSSH private key file, with no passphrase and no seed derivation. It is backed up: losing it loses the address (Section 12.5).
- **A prekey MUST NOT be backed up, synced, derived from a seed, or kept where old versions survive** (a secrets manager, a version-control system, a snapshot): a prekey that survives its deletion voids the forward secrecy of Section 15.3. A working key is not backed up either: a restored mailbox makes new ones.
- **What a client keeps, each by the rule of its section:** each peer's identity, pinned once something it signed has verified (Sections 12.2, 12.3); the latest `(c, p)` it has seen on each peer's statements (Section 6); every revocation it has verified, never removed, which decide the certificates it takes of each peer and of its own (Sections 5.1, 12.5); its replay set and its floor (Section 12.3, check 8); when it signed each of its prekeys (Section 12.4); and its outbox, as written (Section 12.2).
- **A client MUST NOT adopt a server's `Date` as its clock, nor tell its owner to set the clock by it.** When a refusal is for a time, it reports the difference between the two, as the server's word, pointing its owner to a time source the owner trusts: a mailbox checks everything against its own clock, and a clock set by a lying server would make an ended certificate valid again and a stale message fresh.
- **A key that reads messages decrypts those a client fetches (Section 12.3), and nothing else a server sends.**
- **One command of a mailbox at a time.** A client MUST hold a mailbox's lock for the whole of every command that writes the mailbox, so a mailbox has one consumer, and a command that finds it held waits.
- **One mailbox, one place.** A mailbox runs in one place at a time, where its working keys, prekeys and state are kept. A machine that is to run beside it is a mailbox of its own, with its own identity and address; one restored from the identity alone takes the mailbox's place (Section 12.4).

### 12.2. Sending

**Read the recipient's mailbox before every post** (Section 11.8), of a new message and of one that waited, and check it before anything is sealed:

- **Identity:** the pinned one, or at first contact the served one; a pin always wins. The served identity MUST hash to the address and pass Section 4.1, as a server holds it at registration. One of a type the client does not verify is refused, and nothing is sealed. It is pinned only once its prekey statement has verified, and a later read never replaces it.
- **A verifier built on `ssh-keygen`** uses an `allowed_signers` file of exactly one line, chosen by the signing key's form: `<address> <key>` for the identity's own signature, and `<address> cert-authority <key>` for a certificate. It is built for each verification from the identity it has hash-checked, never from a server's text. A revocation is always verified with the first (Section 10.1).
- **The prekey statement:** its signature, by that identity or by a certificate of it that passes every rule of Section 5.2, and every rule of Section 6: its form and namespace, line 2 the recipient's address, its key, its `not_after` not passed, and the statement not earlier than what the sender has seen (Section 5.3). Its `(c, p)` is recorded only after every check passes.
- **Revocations:** what the read carries of a revocation of the recipient's address or certificates is kept once it verifies (Section 12.5). Nothing is posted to an address the sender holds a revocation of, and such an address is refused before any call. A statement under a certificate the recipient's revocation of certificates covers, as the sender then holds it (Section 5.1), is refused, and nothing is sealed.
- **No answer is not "none held."** If the read fails, or serves no mailbox (`404 no_such_mailbox`, or `410 revoked` with nothing that verifies), nothing is sealed or posted, and the message waits in the outbox. A failed read's code is no answer about the message.
- **What the read shows, or leaves out, is the server's word and is kept nowhere,** so the next post reads again.

**The outbox:**

- **A retry posts the same envelope, never a new message.** A new send makes a new `msg_id`, and a reader that acts on messages would act twice. The outbox keeps the envelope until a receipt arrives.
- **A seal is made for one post and never kept.** Each post, the first and every retry, reads the mailbox as above, then dates the envelope (`sent_at` the sender's clock, every other member as it was), seals it to the statement the read passed, signed by the signer in use, and posts it. A message that waited thus goes to what the sender holds at its post.
- **A post is dated after the read, and never before its entry was written.** An entry dated ahead of the clock at its dating waits until the clock passes that time.
- **An entry is posted for 33 days from when it was written,** by the clock at each dating, and never after, so no copy of a message is dated more than 33 days after the first.
- **On `409 stale_prekey`, the sender posts the same envelope again** within the same send: the mailbox read, the envelope dated and sealed anew, as above.
- **A refusal no later post of the message can pass is final:** `bad_address`, `too_large` and `sender_not_allowed` (only the recipient can change its ACL); the message is never posted again. **Any other refusal leaves it in the outbox,** posted again after `Retry-After` where the answer gives one.
- **A mailbox MUST NOT sign a message under a certificate it holds revoked** (Section 10.2): the entry waits until its renewal is taken.
- **A `410 revoked`, to the read or to the send, is checked, never believed** (Section 12.5).
- **A post whose answer is lost costs a send.** The server stored it; the retry is a new ciphertext, which the server stores and counts as a new message, and the recipient delivers the message once (Section 12.3, check 9).

### 12.3. Receiving

A client drains every page of its list (Section 11.11). For each entry it fetches the message (Section 11.12) and reads at most the listed `size`: a body of another length breaks the answer's form, and the drain stops there, with nothing judged or acked and the message still on the server. A fetch that was cut resumes by range; the whole, the bytes kept and the range, is held to the listed `size` and to the id (check 8), as a body read whole is, and a `206` whose `Content-Range` is not the range asked for, or not of the listed size, breaks its form.

**The checks, in this order.** Only a message that passes all of them is accepted.

1. **Decryption** with every retained prekey (`undecryptable`). A reader MAY refuse as `undecryptable`, before any key agreement, a file without exactly one native stanza, which no server takes as a send (Section 11.10, step 7).
2. **The layout** (Section 9.2): the envelope line, then a signature block from line 2 to the first END line, followed by LF (`bad_message`).
3. **The envelope is one JSON object** as Section 3.3 reads one; its body is held to the same rules and passed on as it is (`bad_envelope`).
4. **The sender's identity document,** from the envelope's `identity`: base64, the form of Section 4.1, and a key that passes its checks (`bad_identity`). `from` MUST be its hash (`reattributed`). A well-formed document of a type the reader does not verify, whose hash is `from`, is refused as `unsupported_key_type`.
5. **The signature,** over line 1 exactly as decrypted, in the namespace `dromas-msg-v1:<this mailbox>`, by that identity, or by a working key under a certificate of it that holds now (Section 5.2) (`bad_signature`).
6. **The rest of the envelope,** in this order: a body, and every member of its type (`from` and `to` addresses); `v` the integer 1; `to` this mailbox (`reattributed`); `msg_id` in its form (each other failure `bad_envelope`); and `sent_at` no older than 33 days and not before the mailbox's floor (both `stale`, check 8), and no more than an hour ahead of this mailbox's clock (`future`).
7. **Revocation:** the mailbox holds no revocation of the sender (Section 12.5), and none of the sender's certificates that covers the signer (Section 5.1). The reader asks by one read of the sender's mailbox (Section 11.8), once for each sender in a drain, after that sender's signature has verified; what it carries is kept once it verifies. A revocation of the address refuses the message as `revoked`, and every later one from that address, whenever it was signed. A certificate at or below the serial the sender's revocation of certificates runs through refuses it as `certificate_revoked`. A mailbox served with no revocation, no such mailbox, or `410 revoked` with nothing that verifies is an answer that none is held. Any other result is no answer: the drain stops, and the message stays on the server.
8. **Replay:** the SHA-256 of the ciphertext, computed by the reader, is not in the replay set (`replay`). A listed `id` that differs from it is refused (`bad_id`). The set keeps each message's hash, with its `sent_at`, `from` and `msg_id`, until `sent_at` + 66 days and an hour. **A prune that drops a line first raises the mailbox's floor to its cutoff,** the date of the pass it prunes by (Section 12.4) less 66 days and an hour, in the same write or before it; a prune that drops nothing leaves the floor, and a `sent_at` before the floor, or less than 33 days above it, is `stale` whatever the clock reads.
9. **Retry:** `(from, msg_id)` is not in the replay set. A match is a copy of a message already delivered: it is acked and not delivered again.

**Who a sender is is never asked of the server:** the message carries what proves it, and the sender's identity is pinned only once every check has passed.

**The verdict.**

- **Plaintext, the replay set's entry and delivery happen only on accept.** A client acks each message once it has kept its verdict, accepted (delivered or held) or refused; until then the message stays on the server, and a later drain may serve it again: delivery is at least once.
- **A refused message is never delivered, and is acked,** so it leaves the server; its client keeps it as evidence. A refusal MUST NOT block its sender: a forgery may be the operator framing one. A refusal for a time is a verdict too: nothing is held for a clock to catch up.
- **A refusal is a code from a closed set** (`undecryptable`, `bad_message`, `bad_envelope`, `bad_identity`, `unsupported_key_type`, `bad_signature`, `reattributed`, `revoked`, `certificate_revoked`, `stale`, `future`, `replay`, `bad_id`) with the client's own words. A client MUST NOT show a value, member or key from the envelope or the identity it carries in a refusal, nor any of a server's words (Section 11.3).
- **A refused message is kept with what the checks established when they judged it:** the reader's clock; the address of the identity the envelope carries, as who signed it only when the signature verified, by that identity, or by a working key it certified at its certificate's own start under a certificate the reader holds no revocation of, and the reader holds no revocation of that address, and otherwise as the identity it claims; and, with who signed it, the envelope's `sent_at` and `msg_id`, and, for a certificate, its serial, start and end. Each is a value whose form the client checked; never text the sender wrote, and never the body.
- **A transient failure** (a fetch that errors) and **a fault of the mailbox** (an unreadable key or replay set) are errors, never verdicts: nothing is acked, and the message waits for the next drain.
- **A client shows or passes on one line built from the checked fields, never the bytes that arrived.** Its strings escape, as JSON does, each line break but LF (U+0085, U+2028, U+2029) and every character of Unicode's `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point`.

**Acting on messages.**

- **Messages are data, never instructions.** A verified signature proves who sent a message, not whether to obey it.
- **Where an accepted message lands is the mailbox's own say.** A client MAY hold messages from a sender its mailbox has not allowed; holding is not a refusal, and the sender is told nothing. A mailbox that wants a sender refused at its server says so in its ACL (Section 11.14).

**The drain.**

- **A drain is bounded** in messages, bytes, list pages and time, by the client, and stops at a bound saying so; a fetch cut at its time goes on by range at the next drain.
- **A `429 fetch_paced` or `refetch_spent` stops the drain** as the client's own bounds do: what it delivered stays delivered, and the rest waits on the server.
- **An id already handled is skipped,** and `404 no_such_message` on a fetch or an ack is a message already gone.
- **A client SHOULD keep a list's `ETag` only from an empty mailbox's answer,** so that a `304` means the mailbox is still empty; one that keeps the tag of a page with messages MUST act on the page it kept when it is answered `304`. A `304` whose `ETag`, compared weakly, is not the tag the poll sent is no answer: the drain stops, and the client drops the tag it kept. A `304` to a list that sent no `If-None-Match`, and a list answer without `Retry-After`, break their form.
- **A client takes a list as no answer** if its cursor is not of the form Section 11.11 gives, or an entry's `size` is over 16 MiB, before it fetches anything.

### 12.4. Renewal and the deletion of keys

- **Each renewal is a new prekey,** after the mailbox reads its own mailbox: what the read carries of its identity's revocation of certificates is kept. A mailbox whose current statement its identity signed renews under its identity, or under a certificate (below). One whose current statement is under a certificate renews under a certificate, since a statement its identity signs stands below it (Section 5.3), and a client that holds its identity SHOULD make a new working key and certificate with each, numbered above that revocation (Section 5.2).
- **A mailbox MUST check its own certificate at its own clock before it signs under it:** a mailbox whose clock has gone back past its certificate's start is stopped there.
- **Lifetime.** A prekey is valid for 33 days, or for a shorter lifetime its owner sets, down to a day and three hours. A client renews while at least two hours of its prekey are left, an hour for the renewal's own calls and the hour of room for clocks (Section 3.4), and times its renewals and the early deletion of its retired prekeys by its own record of when it signed each prekey, never by the statement's `not_after`: a prekey with no record is renewed at once, and every retired key is kept while the newest has none.
- **A serial is signed once.** A renewal the server did not take is sent again exactly as it was signed. A client signs a new key, at a later number, only once that statement has ended, or was made for longer than the lifetime now allows, or has no record of when it was made, or is under a certificate its identity has revoked, or is under a certificate that began less than an hour before the mailbox's clock, or under one that runs longer than its server takes (Section 11.18), or another key type is wanted, or its server holds a statement no earlier than it (below). The key passed over is kept and deleted as a retired one.
- **A renewal answered `409 conflict`, or `401 certificate_not_current` under the second pass Section 8 allows, is final for its statement:** the server holds a statement no earlier than it, and takes only a later one (Section 11.9). The mailbox reads itself (Section 11.8): its own statement served is a renewal taken whose answer was lost; any other is a statement it did not make, and whether the mailbox renews again is the rule below.
- **A client MUST NOT use a kept certificate that began less than an hour before its clock:** it was made while the clock read ahead. The statement and working key made with it are made again, by the clock as it reads: for the same prekey at a mailbox's first registration, and at a later number at a renewal.
- **Deletion.** A retired prekey is deleted at its deletion time: at the latest its statement's `not_after` plus the TTL. A drain that stopped at a bound deletes no retired prekey. A client MAY delete earlier all but the newest retired prekey, after a drain that empties the mailbox, by a list the server took under a pass dated more than an hour after the newest retired prekey was made. While a renewal under a new certificate waits, a mailbox whose current statement is under a certificate holds two working keys: the one under its current certificate, which signs its passes, and the one the waiting statement is signed with. The working key before such a renewal is deleted once it is taken.
- **A client deletes keys, and prunes its replay set, by its clock only once a server has taken a pass dated by that clock, and by that pass's date** (its `not_after` less ten minutes), never by a reading of the clock: a drain's once its list is answered, a renewal's once it is taken. While a renewal is untaken, every retired key is kept. Section 15.3 gives the reason.
- **A mailbox its server has forgotten** sends its renewal as a registration (Section 11.7), numbered above what it published.
- **A mailbox reads its own record at its server by every rule of Section 5 but a certificate's dates** (Section 11.8): what it needs of the read is that its identity signed the statement, and where the statement stands in the mailbox's order. A certificate's dates bind what is signed under it, never a renewal past it, so a record its server took is never one the mailbox cannot renew past for a date. A record that does not verify, or stands before what the mailbox published, stops a renewal the mailbox makes on its own; its owner's renewal goes on past it, by renewing above it where the mailbox's statements are its identity's, and by the remedy (Section 12.6) where they are under certificates.
- **A mailbox whose read of itself shows a statement it did not make** MUST say so to its owner, with what it recommends:
  - **Signed by its identity, or under a certificate of a working key the mailbox did not make,** its identity is in another's hands. The mailbox SHOULD recommend that its owner revoke the address (Section 10.1): a revocation of certificates cannot end it, since whoever holds the identity makes a later certificate as easily (Section 15.5).
  - **Under a certificate of the mailbox's own working key,** that key is in another's hands. Where the identity is kept beside the mailbox's other keys, a copy of them holds the identity too, and the mailbox SHOULD recommend revoking the address; otherwise, the remedy of Section 12.6.

  A mailbox that has published a statement of its own MUST NOT renew above one it did not make unless its owner asks. One that has published none, restored from its identity alone, is served its lost machine's statement so, and its first renewal takes the mailbox over. A mailbox MUST NOT sign messages under a certificate of its own working key that such a statement shows another holds: the remedy, or the revocation of the address, takes those messages with it, so the outbox waits for the mailbox's next certificate. A mailbox that signs its messages with its identity does not wait for such a statement: no certificate of its own is in doubt. A mailbox knows of such a statement from its last read of itself: one its server serves only since then is unknown to it until it reads itself again.
- **A mailbox that does not renew** is sent nothing once its prekey's `not_after` passes (`409 prekey_expired` to its senders). Under a certificate it can poll while the certificate lasts, and by its identity's pass where it holds its identity; once the certificate has ended its server takes no pass under it, and a renewal brings the mailbox back while the server keeps it.
- **A mailbox moves to certificates by renewing under one** (Section 11.9), and only when its owner asks: its statements are under certificates from then on (Section 5.3). What it signed with its identity stays good.

### 12.5. Revocation at a client

- **A client takes "revoked" only with a revocation that verifies.** A `410 revoked`, a `403 sender_revoked` or a `401 certificate_revoked` is a server's word. A client verifies the record a `410` carries; it reads the mailbox (Section 11.8) only after a `403 sender_revoked`, its own mailbox, or a `410` that carries no record or one that does not verify, unless that read is what answered. A record that verifies is final. Without one, the call has failed and nothing more: no state changes, and a message stays in the outbox. What a server shows that does not verify counts as nothing shown.
- **On `401 certificate_revoked`, a client reads its own mailbox before it tries again.** A revocation there that verifies and covers the certificate it signs under is final: no second pass is signed for the call, and the mailbox renews instead, under a new certificate. With none, it signs one more pass, as for any `401`.
- **A mailbox asks about revocations, and publishes its own, at its own server alone:** of the recipient by the read before every post, of each sender once in a drain, and whenever its owner says. Where its server holds no mailbox for it, a mailbox reads its own with `GET …/revocations`.
- **What it has verified about an address, from any source and at any time, it keeps for good,** and checks every send and every read against, with no call to anyone. A record handed over is checked and kept as a served one is. "None held" is kept nowhere.
- **A mailbox that holds its own revocation is finished, whatever any server answers.** It signs nothing more as that address: no pass, no message, no certificate; a send is never posted, and a drain, a renewal and every call that carries a pass are refused before anything is asked. It still asks about, keeps and publishes revocations, which carry no pass. One it keeps that no longer verifies is a fault, and stops the same.
- **A publish answered `410 revoked` is done** once the record it carries verifies, or, where it carries none that does, the record the client's read of its mailbox then carries.
- **A client publishes a revocation of an address only with the address written out in full,** as its owner's confirmation, and writes no record unasked.
- **A record made in advance** is the body of the publishing call, and publishing it later needs no mailbox and no key. Whoever holds it can end the address, so it is kept apart from the identity.

### 12.6. The remedy for a taken working key

For a working key taken without the identity that certified it; a taken identity is ended by revoking its address (Section 10.1). Run where the identity is. It revokes, then renews, in that order.

1. **Read what is held,** at the mailbox's own server, and keep what verifies of the mailbox's revocation of its certificates. An answer it cannot use does not stop the remedy.
2. **Revoke every certificate below the number its clock gives,** through the serial one below it, or sign again one through a higher serial that is held already, and publish it once (Section 11.15). A `409 conflict` means the server holds a higher one: the client reads the mailbox again, keeps that one once it verifies, and renews above it. A conflict that shows none that verifies and covers the certificates stops the remedy there, with nothing renewed.
3. **Then renew,** under a new working key and a certificate numbered one above the revocation's serial, and send nothing an earlier renewal left: whoever copied the mailbox while it waited holds that renewal's working key. Until the server takes the new prekey the mailbox signs no message.

A mailbox whose own revocation covers the certificate it uses renews at its next drain.

### 12.7. A mailbox whose identity is held elsewhere

A mailbox whose identity is held elsewhere signs under certificates: the identity's holder makes the mailbox's certificates and revocations; the mailbox keeps everything else (Section 12.1).

- **The mailbox makes each working key and keeps it; the identity's holder certifies only its public half.** The mailbox gives the holder the public key and the lowest serial the certificate may have: one above the highest the mailbox knows of for itself (Section 5.2). The holder numbers the certificate by Section 5.2, at that serial or above, and makes it for no longer than the server's maximum (Section 11.18). The mailbox holds the certificate to every rule of Section 5.2, to a serial no lower than the one it gave and to the key it made, and then renews under it (Section 11.9); one that began less than an hour before the mailbox's clock (Section 12.4) it uses only once that hour has passed. A prekey never leaves the mailbox, and the holder holds no key that reads messages.
- **Between certificates the mailbox renews under its current one:** each renewal a new prekey at a higher prekey serial.
- **A message signed under a certificate is taken only while the certificate holds at its reader's clock** (Section 5.2), and may wait the TTL to be read, so a holder gives the mailbox a certificate at least as often as the server's maximum, less the client's message margin (Section 15.5). **Once the certificate has ended** its server takes no pass under it, and nothing goes on until the holder gives it a later one: the renewal under that one is taken while the server keeps the mailbox (Sections 11.9, 13), and registers the mailbox anew once the server has forgotten it (Section 12.4).
- **Wherever Sections 12.5 and 12.6 have a mailbox renew under a new certificate,** this one waits for its holder to give it one. A certificate the holder gives it is its owner's ask (Section 12.4).
- **A renewal answered `409 conflict` or `401 certificate_not_current`** is final for its statement (Section 12.4), and the mailbox signs no statement at a higher prekey serial to pass the one served: whoever holds the same working key can sign at any serial, and only a later certificate passes it. A `409` whose read shows a statement the mailbox did not make is under its own working key's certificate, which another holds: the mailbox signs no message under it (Section 12.4) and recommends the remedy. After such a `401` it waits for a certificate above the serial the answer names.
- **Both revocations are the holder's** (Section 10). **The remedy (Section 12.6) is split:** the holder runs steps 1 and 2; the mailbox then makes a new working key, never one made before the revocation, the holder certifies it above the revocation's serial, and the mailbox renews under it (step 3).

## 13. What a server stores, and for how long

How a server stores things is its own. What it promises a client is this.

- **Per mailbox:** the identity document; its state (Section 11.6); the current prekey statement and its signature, as they were sent, and served so; that statement's signer, and for a certificate its serial; the sender key types it declared; for the newest retired prekeys, the type, `not_after` and a hash of the key (Section 11.9); when the mailbox was registered; its account, if any; and its ACL. No private key, no pass, and no record of when the mailbox was last seen.
- **Per address, with a mailbox or none:** the identity document and what its identity revoked (Section 10), each kept for good and served to whoever asks.
- **A mailbox is kept until nothing valid for it is left:** until the later of its current prekey's `not_after` plus the TTL and the latest `valid before` of any certificate the server took for it, a date that a registration and every renewal raise and nothing lowers. Past that a server MAY forget it at any moment, and it is then unknown (Section 11.6).
- **Per message:** the ciphertext exactly as the send's body carried it; its size; `received_at` and `expires_at`. Its id is the ciphertext's SHA-256. No sender and no signature: the message's signature, which names its sender, is inside the ciphertext.
- **A `200` or `201` to a send means the message is stored.**
- **A message expires 33 days less an hour and two minutes after it is received,** read or not: the TTL, less the hour of room for clocks, less two minutes for a post's own time from its dating to the server's receipt. `expires_at` is the authority: a server MUST NOT serve a message past it.
- **An ack deletes the message,** and nothing of it is kept (Section 11.10, step 6).
- **A revocation of the address** does to every message in the mailbox what an ack does to one, and the mailbox's record goes with it; the revocation stays. **An ACL** deletes no message (Section 11.14).
- **Logs.** A server MUST NOT log an address or a message id in the clear: each is replaced by a short hash of itself, which only someone already holding it can match. A server MUST NOT log a pass or a request body.

## 14. Compatibility and versioning

Until version 1 is declared stable, nothing is final. From that declaration:

- **A server refuses a member it does not know, and every other reader ignores one** (Section 3.3).
- **Signed statements match their format exactly:** the identity document, the prekey statement, the pass, and the two revocations. A new format takes a new tag. Each namespace is versioned on its own.
- **A new member is optional.**
- **A server MAY add a route.** A client reads a plain `404` or `405` as a route that server does not offer (Section 11.2).
- **A client names its version on every request, and a server says when it stops taking one** (Section 11.17): a `Deprecation` on every answer to a version it deems deprecated, a `Sunset` on every answer to one it will stop taking, and `410 version_retired` once it has. A feature that is not in version 1.0 is a capability the server lists at `GET /v1/` (Section 11.18), or a later minor's, and a client uses it only where the server lists it or names that minor as its latest.
- **`dromas-revoke-v1` stays valid for good,** so a revocation signed in advance keeps working.
- **A new identity key type is an addition inside v1:** the identity document has one form for every type (Section 4.1), so a type defined later takes no new tag, and a mailbox declares the types its client verifies (Section 7).
- **A new prekey type is an addition inside v1** the same way (Section 6).

What version 1 fixes, and where each can grow inside it:

| Fixed | Grows by |
|---|---|
| The signed statements, byte for byte (Sections 4.1, 6, 8, 10); a certificate's type, key id, principal and validity, a window checked at the verifier, whose longest is each server's own (Sections 5.2, 11.18) | a new format under a new tag; a new identity or prekey key type; a certificate extension, which a reader ignores |
| The two signer forms, their ranks, and the order `(c, p)` (Section 5) | nothing |
| The namespaces, `dromas-<purpose>-v1:<address>` | a new purpose |
| A signature's form, and its bound for each key type (Section 3.2) | a new key type, with a bound of its own |
| What is encrypted: the envelope's line, the signature block, the padding (Section 9) | the envelope's optional members; `v` changes only for a breaking change |
| JSON as Section 3.3 reads it; a byte member's one encoding; a message's ciphertext as a send's body | nothing |
| The largest ciphertext, 16 MiB (Section 11.10) | a new version of the protocol |
| The routes, methods, statuses, codes and members (`api/openapi.yaml`) | a route; an optional member; a code, which a client that lacks it reads by its status |
| The pass's scheme and its three parameters (Section 8) | a new scheme |
| An error's `type` (Section 11.3); the link (Section 4.3) | a new code |

## 15. Security considerations

### 15.1. Threat model

Dromas protects a message's content from everyone but its recipient, and its sender's identity from forgery by anyone, the server included. It does not hide from the server who writes to whom.

- **The adversaries:** the server and its operator, whatever terminates TLS for it included (Section 15.8), who see everything stored and in transit; a network attacker, who sees TLS; a registered sender; many cheap identities; and a compromised or prompt-injected mailbox.
- **The assets, in order:** a message's content; its sender's authenticity; the authenticity of a mailbox's keys; availability; metadata.
- **The trust root is the address.** It is exchanged out of band, so whoever delivers it to a sender is trusted to deliver the right one, as with any key fingerprint.
- **Every defence below holds for a client that verifies and gates:** one that runs every check of Section 12 and acts on none that failed. Code or commands a server serves are no such client.

### 15.2. What a hostile server can and cannot do

- **It sees:** addresses, identity documents, certificates, and prekeys; who sends to whom; each message's size to within a padding block (Section 9.3); times and IP addresses; ciphertext; each mailbox's passes; which account a mailbox is in; and each mailbox's ACL, which under an allow list names senders the mailbox takes messages from who may never have written to it.
- **It never sees:** plaintext, a private key, an age file key, or any message's signature. **It holds nothing signed that says who wrote to whom:** a pass names a mailbox and a time, and no recipient and no message.
- **It can:** deny service; drop, delay or delete messages, undetectably; say a mailbox is revoked when it is not, which a client checks and does not believe (Section 12.5); keep a revocation from a peer that has never seen it (Section 15.6); replay old messages, which Section 12.3 refuses; serve a stale prekey to a sender, but only one the mailbox's signer signed, and only until its `not_after`, and not to a sender that has seen a newer one; act as a mailbox toward itself; take messages a mailbox's ACL refuses, which the mailbox's client still judges, or refuse messages it admits, which it could drop anyway; lie once in the ACL a mailbox restored without its own lists adopts, so that a verified sender's messages land as allowed, or messages it could drop anyway are dropped; write anything in an error's words, which a client never shows, or in a receipt, an account id or a cursor, which a client checks to their forms before it uses one (Section 11.3); and serve altered instructions to an agent that runs what it is served.
- **It cannot,** against a client that verifies and gates: read messages, forge a sender, reattribute a message, substitute a key (that would need a SHA-384 second preimage or a signature forgery), alter a message undetected, end an address, make a pass, or turn a pass into plaintext or a signature on a message.

### 15.3. Forward secrecy

- **Every mailbox has forward secrecy, bounded by how often it renews and deletes,** given a client that deletes retired prekeys (Section 12.4): a message is unrecoverable from the mailbox's keys once every prekey it could be encrypted to is deleted, at the latest its statement's `not_after` plus the TTL, 66 days after the prekey was published. A client that renews and empties its mailbox often, and deletes all but the newest retired prekey after an emptying drain, brings that to its second renewal after the message arrived.
- **A message waiting on the server is exposed until the mailbox fetches it.** A mailbox that stops renewing keeps its ended prekey as its current one, and its last messages stay exposed until it renews.
- **A mailbox that no server takes a pass from keeps its retired keys** past their deletion time, until one does: it cannot tell its clock far ahead from a server that refuses it, and deletes by that clock no key that a message may wait for.
- **It depends on real deletion.** A key kept in a backup, a synced folder or a store with version history survives its deletion.
- **There is no per-message forward secrecy and no post-compromise security:** version 1 has no ratchet. A leaked prekey reads all messages encrypted to it until it is renewed and deleted.

### 15.4. Sender authentication

- **Each message carries its sender's signature inside the encryption,** by the sender's identity or by a working key it certified, verified by the recipient. The signature resists key-compromise impersonation: a leaked prekey lets nobody forge a sender to its mailbox.
- **The signature is bound to its recipient,** by the namespace and by the envelope's `to`, so a recipient cannot pass a signed message on to a third mailbox as a message from its sender, the known flaw of signing before encrypting.
- **It is not deniable toward a recipient:** a recipient can show anyone what a sender signed. That is an audit trail for programs that act on messages, and a privacy cost. The server holds no message signature and can prove nothing of who sent what.
- **A message a mailbox cannot decrypt has no sender at all:** the server keeps none (Section 13), so a mailbox restored without its prekeys cannot learn whom to ask to send again.
- **Decrypting precedes verifying.** Until the signature is checked, a reader handles bytes nobody vouched for: age's, then the envelope's line. age is made to be handed files from anyone, and a refusal is acked whatever its reason, so neither the server nor the sender learns which check failed. Each part of what is decrypted has one place, and nothing is searched for (Section 9.2).
- **age to a public key authenticates nobody:** only the signature inside makes a message its sender's. The padding after it is unsigned, and never read.

### 15.5. Stolen keys

- **A stolen identity key is the worst case, and is answered only by revoking the address** (Section 10.1). Its thief can sign as the mailbox, with the identity itself or through a certificate of a working key of its own, publish prekeys and read new messages until the owner revokes the address, which ends the address for good: recovery is a new address, announced out of band. A thief that holds the identity can also revoke, which gains it nothing. A mailbox that signs with its identity keeps it beside its other keys, so a copy of the mailbox is a copy of the identity; one that signs under certificates can keep it elsewhere (Section 12.7), at the cost of a holder who certifies a new working key at least as often as the server's maximum, less the client's message margin.
- **A revocation of certificates does not cover the identity's own signature** (Section 10.2). Refusing that signature would stop no thief: whoever holds the identity makes a certificate above any revocation as easily. What a revocation of certificates answers is a stolen working key, and for that it needs nothing of the identity's signatures.
- **A lost identity key can be revoked only by a record made in advance** (Section 12.5). Without one, the address stops taking messages once its prekey ends, and its correspondents are told the new address out of band.
- **A stolen working key** signs as the mailbox until its certificate ends, if a server delivers the messages, or until a revocation of its certificate. A server takes a statement under a certificate no longer than the server's maximum (Section 11.18), but a reader takes any certificate within its window, and a certificate no server took signs messages while it lasts, and can register its address at a server that has forgotten it. A renewal under a new certificate takes it from the server at once, and from every sender that has seen the newer certificate. A revocation of its certificate ends it everywhere the revocation is seen (Section 12.6). Messages the owner sent under a revoked certificate and not yet read are refused with the thief's.
- **How long a certificate runs is its holder's choice, up to the server's maximum:** a shorter one ends a stolen working key sooner, and needs the identity more often. A certificate is checked at the reader's clock, since nothing vouches for when a signature was made, and a message may wait the TTL before it is read; so a certificate signs messages that every reader takes for the server's maximum, less the client's message margin, the time a client leaves before a certificate ends for what it signed to be read.
- **A stolen pass,** for the minutes it has left and at that server only, gives the mailbox's metadata and its ciphertext; control of its availability (irrecoverable deletion of unacked messages, leaving its account, its ACL, with which it can pause the mailbox until its owner writes the next); and posting in its name, which verifies at no recipient. It never gives plaintext, signs no message and no prekey, and cannot end the address. All of it is within what a hostile server can do (Section 15.2), at the one server the pass names. Hence a pass of ten minutes, kept in a directory only the owner reads.
- **A stolen prekey** reads all messages encrypted to it, until the mailbox renews. A sender that has seen no newer serial can still be served the old statement until its `not_after`, so a mailbox that renews often MAY set a shorter lifetime (Section 12.4).

### 15.6. Revocation's limits

- **A server can keep a revocation from a peer that has never seen it,** answering that it holds none, and nothing tells the peer otherwise. Asking before every post narrows that in time and no further: what a client was shown while its server answered truly, it keeps after that server stops. A server that hides a record from its first answer is answered only by a record from the mailbox's owner, handed over out of band.
- **A mailbox asks its own server alone.** A second server listed beside it would tell against a server that withholds only where the revoked mailbox's owner and the reader list the same one.
- **This protocol bounds no time a revocation can go unseen by a peer whose server hides it.** The usual remedy is key transparency, a log of what a server serves that clients check, which this protocol does not have.

### 15.7. Clocks

- **A mailbox whose clock is further off than the room allows is stopped** before it fetches messages it would judge by that clock, prunes its replay set by it, or deletes a prekey by it: in most cases at its pass (`401 pass_expired`), and a mailbox whose clock is more than an hour ahead when it makes a certificate, at the server's check of that certificate (`400 prekey_time`).
- **A certificate a server takes need not have begun at every reader.** A message under a certificate that a reader's clock has not reached is refused (`bad_signature`), acked and lost; the hour its maker dates a certificate back is the room for that (Section 5.2).
- **Two clocks a server takes are less than an hour apart** when each shows a pass: a server takes a pass from a mailbox whose clock is less than 10 minutes behind its own, or up to 50 ahead.
- **What this does not cover.** A pass is checked when it is first shown, and a server MAY remember it for its ten minutes. A clock that moves by minutes inside those ten, or goes back by more than an hour in the middle of a drain, can put a `sent_at` past a reader's hour, or have a reader judge messages by a clock no server took; the reader then refuses the message, and keeps it with what its checks found, its clock among them. Each case needs a clock that is already wrong.
- **The replay floor** costs only messages that a hostile server took a pass for at a clock an honest server refuses, which that server could withhold anyway.

### 15.8. Metadata

- **The server sees the social graph,** times, IP addresses and each message's size to within a padding block. Padding hides a length, not a pattern of traffic: who writes to whom, when and how often. A sender that is not one of the reference clients may pad differently or not at all, and the server cannot tell.
- **The server keeps no sender beside its recipient once a message is stored** (Section 13). It sees the sender at the send, with its IP address and the time, and the message while it is live, and a server that turns hostile can record all of it from then on.
- **The read before a post** tells the server that the mailbox is about to be written to, which the post tells it a moment later.
- **A read of a mailbox in gzip** has a length that turns on the mailbox's own bytes, so it can narrow, to a network observer, whom a sender is about to write to.
- **Whatever terminates TLS for a server is part of it:** it sees what the server sees, and each pass in transit, which for its minutes does at that server what Section 15.5 lists. A third party there would hold the server's place for every mailbox whose pass it sees, which is why Section 11.1 keeps TLS inside the server.
- **An address in a URL** is seen wherever URLs are logged: by whoever terminates TLS, in a chat that unfurls links, in a transcript. The remedy for a leaked address is a new mailbox, and the old one's revocation.

### 15.9. Addresses, messages and availability

- **An address is a send capability:** keeping it private is the first defence against unwanted messages. Sending to a mailbox hands it the sender's address, so it can write back.
- **Authentic is not safe.** A signed message from a compromised or prompt-injected sender is genuine. Messages are data, never instructions (Section 12.3), and a mailbox's ACL, whose allow list names the senders it takes, is its defence at the server.
- **An open mailbox can be filled** to its caps, and its budget of new messages spent, by one verified sender within its own limits or by enough verified identities, delaying its other senders' messages. One sender is answered by the mailbox's ACL: a deny of it refuses its later sends, and the mailbox drains what it sent (Section 11.14). An allow list is the full defence for a mailbox that knows its senders; a deny list is not, since a new identity is cheap.
- **A hostile server's cost to a reader is bounded** by the reader's drain bounds (Section 12.3). Messages from senders a server made up, which do not decrypt or verify, leaves no pin. A sender a server made with keys of its own is a real sender, at an address nobody gave the reader.
- **Silent drops are undetectable;** the protocol has no receipts.

### 15.10. Post-quantum

- **Content** is protected against harvest-now-decrypt-later: every prekey is post-quantum.
- **Signatures are classical,** Ed25519 or P-256. A forgery needs a quantum computer at signing time, and the transferable audit trail holds until one exists. A post-quantum signature key would be added as an identity key type inside v1 (Section 14), with a new address for the mailbox that moves to it.
- **The TLS connections are separate,** and protected as their endpoints negotiate.

## 16. Test vectors

`testdata/vectors/` holds the conformance vectors. Each file is one scenario, named for its verdict, with its expected outcome; `testdata/vectors/README.md` describes their format and how each is checked. A conforming client passes every vector of the parts it implements. The crypto and container vectors are checked by `age`, `ssh-keygen` and `sha256sum`, tools this project did not write; their keys are published test keys.

## Appendix A. Where `ssh-keygen` differs (informative)

`ssh-keygen -Y verify` checks a signature and does not define one: a client built on it holds a signature to Section 3.2 itself. It takes forms Section 3.2 refuses: a BEGIN line ending in CRLF, whitespace anywhere in the base64, other line lengths, a NUL before the final LF, anything after the END line, version 0, `sha256`, a reserved field that is not empty, a string that no signature covers ending in a NUL, and an ECDSA number with leading zero bytes up to 2,049 bytes in all. Its builds also differ from Sections 3.2 and 4.1:

- **An Ed25519 signature's R.** OpenSSH's own Ed25519 from 10.6p1, libsodium's, used where libcrypto has none, refuses the neutral R, and takes R with a point of order 2 or 4 added; it refuses R with a point of order 8 added.
- **An Ed25519 signature's S.** `ssh-keygen` before 10.3p1 on OpenSSL's Ed25519, and before 10.4p1 on its own, takes S + L.
- **An Ed25519 key.** Go's `crypto/ed25519`, and OpenSSH before 10.6p1, take small-order and non-canonical keys, so a client checks them itself.
- **A P-256 key's coordinates.** OpenSSH up to 10.2p1 refuses a coordinate of 128 bits or fewer, or of n − 1 or more, which OpenSSH from 10.3p1 and `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` take.
- **A P-256 key at all.** OpenSSH built without OpenSSL reads none.
- **Certificates.** `ssh-keygen -Y verify` takes a certificate with a second principal, a critical option, extensions out of order or given twice, or a validity of `forever`, checks no key id, and knows a serial only through a revocation list, so a client built on it reads those fields from the certificate itself.
