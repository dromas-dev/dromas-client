//	the signature over that line, as "ssh-keygen -Y sign" writes it
//	padding, to the end
//
// It is git's layout for a signed tag: the signed bytes as they are, then the
// signature block. Nothing is encoded a second time, and what the layout adds
// is the same number of bytes whatever the message's size.
//
// Three rules for a reader come from what went wrong in verifiers of that
// layout elsewhere. The signature is checked over the first line exactly as
// decrypted, and the envelope's members are read from those same bytes, never
// from anything rebuilt. Each part has one place and nothing is searched for:
// line 1 is the envelope, line 2 begins the signature, the block ends at the
// first END line, and what follows is never read. And there is one signature,
// checked against one identity, the one the envelope carries.
