// Revocations is what a server holds about an address: the body of PUT /v1/<address>/revocation and the answer to GET
// of the same path (PROTOCOL.md §10.3). It proves itself: the document hashes
// to the address and the signature verifies under the document's key, so it
// is worth the same from any server or from a file a person handed over.
//
// It is also the record a mailbox's owner makes in advance and keeps apart from
// the mailbox. It holds the identity document because a mailbox that is lost no
// longer has one.
//
// It names its own type, RecordType, in its member type, so that one JSON
// text is the record a person keeps, the body a server takes, the answer it
// gives, and the line dromas revocation make prints. Every writer writes
// it, in no set order (PROTOCOL.md §10.3); MarshalJSON writes it first, as
// the client prints every line's type. A reader takes a record without it,
// as the route says what the body is, and refuses one that names any other
// type (ErrMemberValue).
