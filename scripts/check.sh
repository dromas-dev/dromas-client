# The tests build with -tags dromas_nofsync, so no write is flushed to the
# disk (client/fsync.go): a test kills a process, never the machine. -short
# skips the long tests, each of which says so; CI never passes it. On macOS,
# Windows and the BSDs ./sh is left to the Linux runs: the script is held to
# GNU's and uutils' tools (README § The shell client), and its tests, a few
# thousand short processes, take from 3 to more than 20 minutes on a Mac,
# where a process costs less than on Windows (go test ./sh still runs them,
# with bash 4 or later and GNU coreutils first in PATH).
