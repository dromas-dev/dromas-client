# dromas.sh: the dromas client in stock tools (bash, age, ssh-keygen, curl, jq, iconv and coreutils).
#
# The same protocol and checks as the Go client in this repo, on a mailbox of its own: the proof that a mailbox made of stock tools exchanges messages with a
# Go mailbox (AGENTS.md § The shell client), not a client to run. It fails CLOSED:
# a failed check prints an error line, "REFUSED: <reason>", and stops (recv refuses that one message with a refused line, its code and its words, and goes on), and every API error prints its status and its code, and none of the server's words.
# It prints JSON lines, as the Go client does, each with its "type" first: what a command did and met on stdout, and on stderr the
# line that says it failed ("error", here sometimes more than one), that its command line was wrong ("usage_error"), or that it waits.
# Get it from https://github.com/dromas-dev/dromas-client at a commit you have read, never from the dromas.dev
# server: a server that could hand you this script could hand you one without its checks.
#
#   bash dromas.sh init                            make and register this mailbox; prints its link, $DR_SERVER_URL/to/<address>
#   bash dromas.sh addr                            print it again: give it to whoever should write to this mailbox
#   bash dromas.sh send <link> [file]             one message (the body from stdin without a file); a link or an address. Posted now or not at all: nothing waits
#   bash dromas.sh recv                            verified messages, a "message" line each; a refused one goes to refused/, with a "refused" line
#   bash dromas.sh prekey renew                    a new prekey, which the identity signs: at least monthly, as a prekey is valid for 33 days, or within the lifetime a prekey-lifetime file sets
#   bash dromas.sh help [<command>]                this, or a command's lines; --help after a command does the same, and runs nothing
#   The README has the rest: https://github.com/dromas-dev/dromas-client#readme
#
# Or source it at the top of every shell call and call the dr_* functions. Agent tools run each command in a fresh
# shell, so all state lives in files in the mailbox's directory, never in variables.
#
# It gives up conveniences the Go client has: recv drains once and never waits for a message, and each step runs several
# programs. And certificates: its own mailbox's identity signs its prekey statements, passes and messages (PROTOCOL.md §5),
# and it makes no working key. It reads and writes to mailboxes that sign either way. Needs bash >= 4, age >= 1.3 (the first with post-quantum keys, the one prekey type; Ubuntu to 26.04 and Debian 13
# ship older, and go install filippo.io/age/cmd/...@v1.3.2 is current), OpenSSH >= 9.1 (the first to take a
# certificate's validity and a time to verify at in UTC), curl >= 7.84 (--fail-with-body, and -w with %header),
# jq >= 1.7.1 (1.7.0 can abort on a number a sender writes, CVE-2023-50246; Ubuntu 24.04's fixed jq prints jq-1.7),
# iconv, and coreutils (sha256sum, sha384sum, base64, od, sync). Dates go through jq, never date -d, and base64 is never -w0.
